It's …,Go on. Father's watching.
Go on. Father's watching.,And your mother.
"And which one of you was a marksman at ten? Keep practicing, Bran. Go on.","Don't think too much, Bran."
"In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, first of his name …",Don't look away.
King of the Andals and the First Men …,Father will know if you do.
"Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, sentence you to die.",You did well.
A madman sees what he sees.,What is it?
There are no direwolves south of the Wall.,Now there are five.
Now there are five.,You want to hold it?
"I'm sorry, Bran.",Lord Stark? There are five pups. One for each of the Stark children. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. They were meant to have them.
What about you?,I'm not a Stark. Get on.
"In any case, candles.",Why's your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king?
Is he dead yet?,Uncle Benjen!
You got bigger. I rode all day. Didn't want to leave you alone with the Lannisters. Why aren't you at the feast?,Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst.
"Well, you're always welcome on the wall. No bastard was ever refused a seat there.",So take me with you when you go back.
Jon…,"Father will let me if you ask him, I know he will."
The Wall isn't going anywhere.,I'm ready to swear your oath.
You don't understand what you'd be giving up. We have no families. None of us will ever father sons.,I don't care about that.
Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.,What're you doing back there?
Preparing for a night with your family. I've always wanted to see the Wall.,You're Tyrion Lannister. The queen's brother?
"Did I offend you? Sorry. You are the bastard, though.",Lord Eddard Stark is my father.
"And Lady Stark is not your mother. Making you a bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor. Then it can never be used to hurt you.",What the hell do you know about being a bastard?
A sword for the wall?,I already have one.
Good man. Have you swung it yet?,Of course I have.
"At someone, I mean. It's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man. You realize we're nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing. Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall... Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot. We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us.",We've guarded the Kingdoms for 8 000 years.
Is it we already? Have you taken your vows then?,Soon enough.
"Thank you, Nymeria. Septa Mordane says I have to do it again. My things weren't properly folded, she says. Who cares how they're folded?! They're going to get all messed up anyway.",It's good you've got help.
"Watch. Nymeria, gloves.",Impressive.
"Shut up. Nymeria, gloves!",I have something for you. And it has to be packed very carefully.
A present?,Close the door. This is no toy. Be careful you don't cut yourself.
It's so skinny.,"So are you. I had the blacksmith make it for you special. It won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough."
I can be quick.,You'll have to work at it every day. How does it feel? Do you like the balance?
I think so.,First lesson
I know which end to use.,"I'm going to miss you... Careful... All the best swords have names, you know."
Sansa can keep her sewing needles. I've got a needle of my own.,I came to say goodbye to Bran.
You've said it.,"I wish I could be here when you wake up. I'm going north with Uncle Benjen. I'm taking the black. I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better. I'll know my way around by then. I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if you're not afraid."
You've said goodbye to Bran? He's not going to die. I know it.,You Starks are hard to kill.
My mother?,She was very kind.
"Good. Next time I see you, you'll be all in black.",It was always my color.
"Farewell, Snow.","And you, Stark."
"There's great honor serving in the Night's Watch. The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years. And you are a Stark. You might not have my name, but you have my blood.","Is my mother alive? Does she know about me? Where I am, where I'm going? Does she care?"
Rapers. They were given a choice no doubt... Castration or the Wall. Most choose the knife. Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch... You discard your old family and get a whole new one.,Why do you read so much?
Look at me and tell me what you see.,Is this a trick?
"What you see is a dwarf. If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years.",Until your brother killed that King.
"Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you? What's your story, bastard?","Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf."
"A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Night's Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms.",The Night's Watch protects the realm from...
"You broke my nose, bastard!",It's an improvement.
"We'll talk later, Lord Snow.",Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same.
Grenn's father left him too... Outside a farmhouse when he was three. Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese. His little sister hadn't eaten in three days. He was given a choice,They hate me because I'm better than they are.
I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time. I'm leaving this morning.,You're leaving?
I'm the First Ranger. My job is out there. There have been disturbing reports.,What kind of reports?
The kind I don't want to believe.,m ready. I won't let you down.
"You're not going. You're no ranger, Jon.",But I'm better than every...
Don't worry. I'll catch you. The horde's easy to find.,Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target. Except for you. You move too much. I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.
I know.,"I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister."
It's either me or this cold. And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.,Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South?
I expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.,"If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. Tell him I'd visit if I could."
Of course.,He'll never walk again.
"If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple. Take care, Snow.","Farewell, My Lord."
"I've offended you. Forgive me, it's been a rough morning. Anyway, don't despair. I'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I've learned to live with it. Your next tumble with Ros is on me. I'll try not to wear her out.","Leg, shoulder, leg. Left foot forward. Good. Now pivot as you deliver the stroke. Put all your weight behind it."
"On your feet. Pick up your sword. Hit him till he finds his feet. It seems they've run short of poachers and thieves down south. Now they send us squealing bloody pigs. Again, harder.",Enough! He yielded.
"Looks like the bastardo s in love. All right then, lord Snow, you wish to defend your lady love, let's make it an exercise. You two. Three of you ought to be sufficient to make lady piggy squeal. All you've got to do is get past the bastard.",Are you sure you want to do this?
Did he hurt you?,I've had worse.
You can call me Sam... If you want. My mother calls me Sam.,"It's not going to get any easier, you know? You'll have to defend yourself."
I'm a coward. My father always says so.,The Wall's no place for cowards.
"Hello. Ser Alliser said I'm to be your new watch partner. I should warn you, I don't see all that well.",Come stand by the fire. It's warmer.
"No, that's all right. I'm fine.",You're not. You're freezing.
I don't like high places.,"You can't fight. You can't see. You're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably. What are you doing here, Sam?"
"On the morning of my 18th nameday, my father came to me. You're almost a man now, he said, but you're not worthy of my land and title. Tomorrow, you're going to take the black, forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north. If you do not, he said, then we'll have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble and you'll be thrown from your saddle to die. Or so I'll tell your mother. Nothing would please me more. Ser Alliser's going to make me fight again tomorrow, isn't he?","Yes, he is."
"I'm not going to get any better, you know?",Well… You can't get any worse.
Where have you been?,Watch duty. With Sam.
Prince Porkchop. Where is he?,He wasn't hungry.
Impossible!,"That's enough. Sam's no different from the rest of us. There was no place for him in the world, so he's come here. We're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore. Never again, no matter what Thorne says. He's our brother now and we're going to protect him."
"You are in love, Lord Snow. You girls can do as you please. But if Thorne puts me up against Lady Piggy, I'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon.",No one touches Sam.
I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in Mole's Town.,I wouldn't doubt it.
Don't you think it's a little bit unfair? Making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side?,Sally on the side?
"It's silly, isn't it? What, we can't defend the Wall unless we're celibate? It's absurd.",I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.
Why not? Because I'm fat? But I like girls just as much as you do. They might not like me as much. I've never... been with one. You've probably had hundreds.,"As a matter of fact, I'm the same as you."
I find that hard to believe.,"I came very close once. I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but..."
You didn't know where to put it?,I know where to put it.
Was she... Old and ugly?,Young and gorgeous. A whore named Ros.
What color hair?,Red.
I like red hair. And her... Her...,You don't want to know.
That good?,Better.
Oh no. So why exactly did you not make love to Ros with the perfect...,What's my name?
Jon Snow?,And why is my surname Snow?
Because... You're a bastard from the north.,"I never met my mother. My father wouldn't even tell me her name. I don't know if she's living or dead. I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife... Or a whore. So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. But I couldn't do it. Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? It's not a good life for a child."
"A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors. It's still summer. Do you boys even remember the last winter? How long has it been now? What, 10 years? I remember. Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell? Were there days when you just couldn't get warm, never mind how many fires your servants built?",I build my own fires.
I miss girls.,Why is he alone?
"One blast for a Ranger returning, two for Wildlings, three for...",There's no rider.
"Whoa, boy, whoa.",That's my Uncle Benjen's horse.
Here you begin anew.,"I do, my lord."
You'll want to take your vow before a heart tree as your Uncle did.,"Yes, my lord."
"Samwell, you will assist me in the rookery and library.",Will I serve the Lord Commander's meals and fetch hot water for his bath.
Certainly. And keep a fire burning in his chambers.,Do you take me for a servant?
We took you for a man of The Night's Watch.,May I go?
"Jon, wait! Don't you see what they're doing?","I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all."
Now listen to me. The old man is the Lord Commander of The Night's Watch.,"I just, I always wanted to be a Ranger."
Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party?,"Just these two, My Lord. Been dead awhile, I'd say."
There is none.,We should burn them.
"Bring me a horn of ale, Snow, and pour one for yourself.",Is there any word of my father?
I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid.,My sisters were in King's Landing too.
When does Aemon think you'll be able to use that hand?,"Soon, he says."
"Good. You'll be ready for this, then. l thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear so l had a new pommel made. lt's called Longclaw. Works as well for a wolf as a bear, l think.",This is Valyrian steel.
"lt was my father's sword, his father before him. The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries. lt was meant for my son Jorah. He brought dishonor to our House, but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from Westeros.","My lord, you honor me, but l can't –"
"Oh, you can. And you will. l wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for you and your beast. A bloody dead man tried to kill me, so you'll take it. l'll hear no more about it. ls that understood?","Yes, my lord."
"Right. Now, don't think this means l approve of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne. That's a man's sword. lt'll take a man to wield it.",l'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight.
"Go on, let's have a look.",At what?
Look at its eyes.,What is it?
l - l can't.,You can't what?
l'm really not supposed to say.,And yet you really want to say. You want to say that…
There was a raven. l read the message to Maester Aemon. lt's your brother Robb.,What? What about him?
"He's heading south. To war. All his bannermen have rallied to his side, they'll keep him safe.",l should be there. l should be with him.
Then l consent.,Sam said you wanted to see me?
"l did indeed. Perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me. Tell me, did you ever wonder why the men of the Night's Watch take no wives and father no children?",No.
"So they will not love. Love is the death of duty. lf the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do?","He would do whatever was right, no matter what."
"Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000. Most of us are not so strong. What is honor compared to a woman's love? And what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms? Or a brother's smile?",Sam told you.
"We're all human. Oh, we all do our duty when there's no cost to it. Honor comes easy then. Yet sooner or later in every man's life there comes a day when it is not easy. A day when he must choose.",And this is my day? ls that what you're saying?
"Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh, yes. l know.","You do not know. No one knows. l may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother."
The gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows. They waited till l was old. What could l do when the ravens brought the news from the South,Who are you?
"My father was Maekar, the first of his name. My brother Aegon reigned after him when l had refused the throne. And he was followed by his son Aerys whom they called the Mad King.",You're Aemon Targaryen.
You can't!,"Get out of my way, Sam."
They'll put out the word. They'll send out ravens. People will come after you. Do you know what happens to deserters?,Better than you do.
What are you going to do?,l'm gonna find my brother and put a sword through King Joffrey's throat.
You can't leave us now. We need you here.,Move.
No.,Hyah!
l know what a Hand needs.,Ghost?
Lucky you've got plenty of padding. We're taking you back to where you belong.,l belong with my brother.
They'll kill you if they find out you've gone.,They'll kill you if they know you came after me. Go back.
But it doesn't matter. You took the oath. You can't leave.,l have to.
You can't. You said the words.,I don't care about –
Hear my words and bear witness to my vow,To hell with all of you.
Ham. How many days in a row must a man be expected to start his day with ham? Bring me some beer at least. You look exhausted. Was your moonlight ride that tiring?,My friends brought me back.
l didn't say it was your honor.,They killed my father.
"And you're gonna bring him back to life, are you? No? Good. We've had enough of that sort of thing. Beyond the Wall, the Rangers are reporting whole villages abandoned. At night they see fires blazing in the mountains from dusk until dawn. A captured wildling swears their tribes are uniting in some secret stronghold, to what ends the gods only know. Outside Eastwatch Cotter Pyke's men discovered four blue-eyed corpses. Unlike us, they were wise enough to burn them. Do you think your brother's war is more important than ours?",No.
Good. Because l want you and your wolf with us when we ride out beyond the Wall tomorrow.,Beyond the Wall?
This is… bad time to start.,Having a rough time of it?
All the other wildlings for a hundred leagues have disappeared. Craster's still here. He must be doing something right.,What happens to the boys?
Hmm?,He marries his daughters. What does he do with his sons?
"People make all sorts of plans. I haven't seen Benjen Stark in three years. Haven't missed him. Always treated me like scum. . Haven't had any good wine for a long time. You Southerners make good wine, I'll give you that.",We're not Southerners.
Who's this little girl? You're prettier than half my daughters. You got a nice wet twat between your legs? What's your name?,Jon Snow.
Who am I? Who am I?,Lord commander.
Who are you?,Your steward.
"He marries his daughters, and they give him more daughters.",What happens to the boys? What does he do with his sons?
You're very brave.,What're you doing?
"This is Gilly, she's one of Craster's daughters.","Hello, Gilly. What're you doing?"
Sam said you could help.,"I'm sorry, Sam knows we're not supposed to -"
"She's pregnant. . We have to take her with us, when we leave.",What? .
I know it sounds a bit mad.,"No it doesn't sound a bit mad, it's impossible."
"The Lord Commander, , we are sworn to protect -",Sam we can't take her -
"Please sir, please. I can still run if I have to.",It's just not possible.
"I'm going to have a baby, if it's a boy I…","If it's a boy what? . You want us to risk our lives for you, and you won't even tell us why."
Why did you do that?,"Do what, ask her a question?"
You were cruel.,Cruel! Sam are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?
I didn't touch her!,No you just want to steal her. What do you think Craster cuts off for that?
"I can't steal her, she's a person not a goat.","We're heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory. We can't take a girl with us. Mormont wouldn't have it. And even if he would, what would we do with her? Who's gonna deliver her baby? You?"
I could try. . What? I've read about it. A bit.,"I'm sorry Sam, we can't help her."
Wait outside.,Lord Commander-
What did you do?,"I followed him. He took the baby into the woods, the newborn."
What business is that of yours?,"No, you don't understand. He's killing them, all the boys..."
"No, you don't understand. He's killing them, all the boys...",You know.
Wildlings serve crueler gods than you or I. Those boys are Craster's offerings.,Offerings? He's murdering his own children. He's a monster.
"Aye, many a time that monster has been the difference between life and death for our rangers, your uncle among them. We have other wars to fight, out there. Like it or not, we need men like Craster.",I... I saw it. I saw... something take that child.
"He's not here yet. He'd have seen us, blown the horn.",When will he come?
The Halfhand does things in his own time.,My uncle told me stories about him.
Most of them are true.,I heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the Wall.
The whole winter. He was north of the Skirling Pass when the snows came. Had to wait for the thaw.,So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own.
Stupid. Smart people don't find themselves in places like this.,I think they were afraid. I think they came here to get away from something. And I don't think it worked.
Wildlings?,One blast is for rangers returning. Wildlings is two blasts.
I read it in a book.,Look. It's Qhorin Halfhand.
I don't see very well.,A fire.
"From what we can tell, all of them. Mance has gathered them all like deer against the wolves. They're almost ready to make their move.",Where?
"It's not a job for 400 men. I need to move fast and silent. Harker, Stonesnake, Borba.","Lord Commander, I'd like to join Lord Qhorin."
"I've been called lots of things, but that might be my first Lord Qhorin. You're a steward, Snow, not a ranger.",I've fought and killed a wight. How many rangers can say that?
"I'll do anything, please! No, please stop it!","Ghost, stay with us. Ghost!"
There goes your pet.,He's not a pet.
"No, you're right, he's not. You can't tame a wild thing. You can't trust a wild thing.",Ghost is different.
"So you think. Wild creatures have their own rules, their own reasons. And you'll never know them. Now the wildlings we're looking for sleep during the day and hunt at night.",I thought you said you couldn't know wild things.
I said you can't. They find a nice cave to hide in while the sun's up and do their killing when it's dark.,We could do the same.
"No, we couldn't. This is their country. They know where to walk, where not to walk. I've lost good men who fell into a crevasse they didn't see till they were in it.",My father always said I'm of the North.
My father always said I'm of the North.,I wasn't joking.
"No, you don't. We're at war. We've always been at war. It's never going to end 'cause we're not fighting an enemy. We're fighting the North, and it's not going anywhere. The Watch has given you a great gift. You only have one thing to give in return, your life.",I'll gladly give my life.
"I don't want you to be glad about it. I want you to curse and fight until your heart's done pumping. And know this, boy. Your death will be a gift for them south of the Wall. They'll never know what you've done. They'll never know how you died. They won't even know your damn name. But they'll be alive because some nameless bastard north of the Wall gave his life for theirs. Now, do you understand me?",I do.
Hmm.,A girl.
A wildling.,We could question her.
You could. She won't answer. I've known a wildling to bite off his tongue instead of talking.,What's your name?
I gave you my name.,I'm Jon Snow.
We have no food for her. Can't spare a man to watch her. Can't let her go. She'll bring Mance Rayder's army down on us. It needs to be done. Want me to do it?,"No. No, I'll do it."
"You never killed a woman before, did you? You don't need to do it. Mance would take you. I know he would. There's secret ways. The crows would never catch us.",I'm as much a crow as they are.
Will you burn me? After?,Can't. Someone might see the smoke.
"The sun's going down, Jon Snow. And your friends are nowhere close.",I'll find them.
Your brothers desert you? I can tell you which way to go.,We'll stop here. Too dark to go any farther today.
Here? There's no shelter here.,There's no shelter anywhere.
There is if you know where to look. The cold could kill us both. If you light a fire-,No fire.
Think they're out looking for you?,Yes.
"You're brave. Stupid, but brave.",We start again at first light. Get some sleep.
We start again at first light. Get some sleep.,Stop moving.
I'm just trying to get comfortable.,Stop it!
Stop it!,You're still moving.
What's the matter? Can't be the first time you pressed your bone against a woman's arse.,Let's move.
"It is the first time. How old are you, boy?",I'm a man of the Night's Watch.
You're a boy who's never been with a girl. Don't your stones start to hurt if your bone never gets-,Don't call them that.
"What, stones? Or bone?",Neither. Both.
Neither. Both.,Move!
"I heard they get all swollen and bruised if you don't use them. Of course, maybe that's just what the lads say when they want me feeling sorry for them. As if I'd feel sorry for them. Are there no girl crows?","There are no women of the Night's Watch, no."
So the lads just do it with each other?,No.
Never?,Never. We swore an oath.
"You have sheep at the Wall? With your hands, then? No wonder you're all so miserable.",Would you please shut up?
"Would you please shut up? You think you're better than me, crow. I'm a free woman.",You're a free woman?
"I might be your prisoner, but I'm a free woman.","If you're my prisoner, you're not a free woman. That's what prisoner means."
And you think you're free? You swore some stupid oath and now you can never touch a girl.,It was my choice to say the words.
So you don't like girls?,Of course I like girls.
But you chose never to touch them.,That's the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch.
"So instead of getting naked with a girl, you'd prefer to invade our lands-","Invade your lands? Wildlings raid our lands all the time. Some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy!"
They're not your lands! We've been here the whole time. You lot came along and just put up a big wall and said it was yours.,"My father was Ned Stark. I have the blood of the First Men. My ancestors lived here, same as yours."
"You think we're savages because we don't live in stone castles. We can't make steel as good as yours, it's true, but We're free. If someone tried to tell us we couldn't lie down as man and woman, we'd shove a spear up his arse. We don't go serving some shit king who's only king because his father was.","No. No, you serve Mance Rayder, the King beyond the Wall."
You're a pretty lad. The girls would claw each other's eyes out to get naked with you.,Walk.
I could teach you how to do it.,I know how to do it.
How long till we get back to your crows?,We're close.
What do you think they'll say when they hear about you and me?,Nothing happened between you and me.
"I swear it, Old Master King Crow, ser, we were only close together for warmth. And then I felt it, right up against me backside like a club. I can show you the bruise on me tailbone. And before I knew what was where, his his Well, it was all out in the open, all angry as you like. And I didn't want to want it, but oh, I did! And he spread me legs and ruined. The shame of it. Now I can never marry a perfumed lord. What will me poor savage father say?",Turn back around.
"And I thought that we were done, but he said, ''Turn back around.' I'll tell you what, Jon Snow. Since it's gonna be your word against mine, and since you can't talk about it without blushing, we may as well just-","What, right here in the muck?"
Are you that afraid of it?,That's enough.
It's nice and wet and warm.,Enough!
"We're even now, Jon Snow.","I couldn't do it. I had the sword on her neck, I just couldn't-"
I know.,The others?
"When you didn't come back, we went looking for you. We found your tracks fast enough. But they found us before we found you.",They died because of me.
"Mance is gonna march on the Wall. When he does, one brother inside his army will be worth a thousand fighting against it.",They'll never trust me.
They might. If you do what needs to be done.,What?
How does it feel knowing those men all died so you could skip through the snow with your little savage girl?,I didn't.
"We should be there by sundown. Won't be a fun night for you. Mance knows how to make crows sing. If you know what to say, you might just make it through the night. Not talking's not the way to go.",Careful with that. You might cut yourself.
Careful with that. You might cut yourself.,"Never swung a sword before, have you? You look like a baby with a rattle."
Enough of that!,Stop!
You're wearing the wrong color.,Mance was a ranger.
"In your hearts, all you crows want to fly free.","When I'm free, will I be free to go?"
"And I'll be free to kill you. Got no respect, this lot. Got no fathers to slap 'em when they're foul.",What happened to their fathers?
That half-handed cunt killed friends of mine. Friends twice your size.,My father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts.
"Plenty of little men tried to put their swords through my heart. And there's plenty of little skeletons buried in the woods. What's your name, boy?",Jon Snow.
Jon Snow.,Your Grace.
He was my brother once. Back when he had a whole hand. What were you doing with him?,The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning.
Why?,He wants me to lead one day.
"But here you are, a traitor kneeling before the King-Beyond-the-Wall.","If I'm a traitor, then you are, too."
"Why do you want to join us, Jon Snow?",I want to be free.
"No, I don't think so. I think what you want most of all is to be a hero. I'll ask you one last time ... why do you want to join us?",We stopped at Craster's Keep on the way north. I saw...
You saw what?,I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods. I saw what took it.
You're telling me you saw one of them? And why would that make you desert your brothers?,"Because when I told the Lord Commander, he already knew. Thousands of years ago, the First Men battled the White Walkers and defeated them. I want to fight for the side that fights for the living. Did I come to the right place?"
"King Robert is dead. I have been searching for you, Daenerys Stormborn, to ask your forgiveness. I was sworn to protect your family. I failed them.","Don't think too much, Bran."
"Don't think too much, Bran.",Relax your bow arm.
Was it hard for you to kill the Halfhand?,Yes.
"You liked him? I like you, but if you're playing us false, it won't be hard for me to kill you. I've got wildling blood in my veins. These are my people.",I understand.
"Well, how could you understand?",You want to protect your people.
"Do you know what it takes to unite 90 clans, half of whom want to massacre the other half for one insult or another? They speak seven different languages in my army. The Thenns hate the Hornfoots. The Hornfoots hate the ice-river clans. Everyone hates the cave people. So you know how I got moon worshippers and cannibals and giants to march together in the same army?",No.
Shouldn't be long now.,What's wrong with him?
Always the artists.,It's only horses. No men.
How many men were here?,About three hundred.
We're all the same to them - meat for their army.,Do you think anyone got away?
Orell says there are crows patrolling on the Wall. Tell me what you know.,"There are four to a patrol- two builders to check for structural damage, two rangers to watch for enemies."
How often do these patrols go out?,"It varies. If I knew where on the Wall we were heading, I could tell you."
There are nineteen castles guarding the Wall. How many are manned?,Three.
Which three?,Castle Black.
"Aye, Castle Black. Everyone knows Castle Black. Which others?",Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and the Shadow Tower.
How many men remain in Castle Black?,A thousand.
Liar.,What happens to your eagle after I kill you? Does he drift away like a kite with his strings cut or does he just flop dead to the ground?
"I like you, boy. But if you lie to me, I'll pull your guts out through your throat.",A thousand men.
We'll find out soon enough.,I don't need you to protect me.
Of course you do. Who stopped Rattleshirt when he was about to cut your throat? Who vouched for you with Mance? It seems you owe me a debt.,Give it back.
"Well, I stole it. It's mine. If you want it, come steal it back.",Ygritte! Ygritte!
Ygritte! Ygritte!,Ygritte! Seven hells. Ygritte!
Is Orell right? Are you still a crow? It's time you proved yourself.,Ygritte.
All of me.,We shouldn't.
That thing you did with your mouth- is that what lords do to their ladies in the South?,I don't know. I just wanted to kiss you there is all.
Hmm.,You seemed to like it.
"Aye, I liked it some. Who taught you that?",There's been no one else. Only you.
A maid. You were a maid.,I was a man of the Night's Watch. How about you? Were you a maid?
What do you think?,Who was he?
"Just a boy. He came trading with his brothers. He had red hair like me. Kissed by fire. But he was weak. Not like you. That was the first one. Then there was this Thenn boy. Spoke no Common, but gods, he was built like a mammoth.","Yeah, thanks. I think I've heard enough. We'd best get back. Tormund-"
Your flock gets smaller every year.,You ever climbed it before?
No. But Tormundo s done it half a hundred times. You're afraid.,Aren't you?
"I brought a pair for you. They're too big for you, but they're good.",You kill someone for them?
He wasn't good to me the way you're good to me. He didn't do that thing you do with your tongue.,Can we not talk about that here?
"Can we not talk about that here? I'm Jon Snow. I've killed dead men and Qhorin Halfhand, but I'm scared of naked girls.",Did I seem scared the other day?
You were trembling like a leaf.,Only in the beginning.
"Only in the beginning. You're a proper lover, Jon Snow. And don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.",What secret?
It's you and me that matters to me and you. Don't ever betray me.,I won't.
No!,Take my hand!
How far are we?,"About a week, I think."
You think? You don't know?,"When we went to Castle Black, we took the Kingsroad."
You and your roads. Is that how you lot do your fighting? You march down the road banging drums and waving banners?,"Most of the time, yes."
How do the men holding the banners fight?,"They don't, really. It's a great honor to carry your house sigil."
"And the drummers- is that a great honor, too?",Usually it's the young boys banging the drums.
So what good are they?,They help the men march.
How?,"Well, it's- it's the rhythm."
"Oh, you mean right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot? You need help remembering that? When Mance gives the signal and we hit Castle Black, we won't be banging on drums to let them know we're coming.","No. No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know you're coming."
"She's right, you don't.",I know you cut me loose on the Wall.
"Cut her loose, too. Do you see her sulking about it? That's because she understands the way things are.",And are you gonna share it with me? The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird?
"No! No! No! Please, no! No! No! No, please! Please!",You're gonna scare it off.
I'm not gonna scare it. I'm gonna kill it.,It's too far away.
Is that a palace?,It's a windmill.
Windmill. Who built it? Some king?,Just the men who used to live here.
"They must have been great builders, stacking stones so high.",Winterfell has towers three times that size.
I'm Jon Snow and I'm from Winterfell. My daddy was a fancy lord and I lived in a tower that touched the clouds.,"If you're impressed by a windmill, you'd be swooning if you saw the Great Keep at Winterfell."
What's swooning?,Fainting.
What's fainting?,When a girl sees blood and collapses.
Why would a girl see blood and collapse?,Well not all girls are like you.
My dress is made of the purest silk from Tralalalaleeday.,I'd like to see you in a silk dress.
Would you?,So I could tear it off you.
"Well, you rip my pretty silk dress, I'll blacken your eye.",Maybe one day I'll take you to Winterfell.
Or maybe one day I'll take you there. After we've taken our land back.,"Ygritte. You won't win. I know your people are brave, no one denies that."
You know nothing-,"Six times in the last thousand years, a King has attacked the kingdoms. Six times they failed."
And how do you know that?,"Every boy in the North knows it. We grow up learning it. Where the battles were fought, the names of the heroes, who died where. Six times you've invaded and six times you've failed. The seventh will be the same."
Mance is different.,You don't have the discipline. You don't have the training. Your army is no army. You don't know how to fight together.
You don't know that.,"I do. I know it. If you attack the Wall, you'll die. All of you."
"You're mine as I'm yours. And if we die, we die. But first we'll live.","Yes, first we'll live."
What's one old man doing with eight horses?,He breeds them for the Watch.
How's he keep folks from stealing them?,The Watch protects him.
Let's carve him up.,We just take the horses and go. The old man's no threat.
He's an old man. A spear through the heart's a better way to die than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear.,The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief. They'll send a lot more to hunt down murderers.
Spread out. Surround the hut and move in.,Ygritte!
Do it. They'll find us if you don't.,You were right the whole time.
Valar morghulis.,"Ygritte, you know I didn't have a choice. You always knew who I was, what I am."
"Ygritte, you know I didn't have a choice. You always knew who I was, what I am.",I have to go home now. I know you won't hurt me.
"You know nothing, Jon Snow.",I do know some things. I know I love you.
I do know some things. I know I love you.,I know you love me. But I have to go home now.
I don't think he can see us.,Pyp? Sam?
Draw. Loose.,"Last time I saw him, he was in the courtyard at Winterfell. He said,  Next time I see you, you'll be all in black. I was jealous of Robb my whole life. The way my father looked at him, I wanted that. He was better than me at everything... fighting and hunting and riding and girls. Gods, the girls loved him. I wanted to hate him, but I never could."
They're... they're ready for you.,He's wanted to hang me for a while. Now's his chance.
No one's going to hang you. You've done nothing wrong.,I've done plenty wrong.
So you admit you murdered Qhorin Halfhand?,I didn't murder him.
No? You put your sword through a brother of the Night's Watch. What do you call that?,He wanted me to kill him.
A bastard son of a traitor. What would you expect?,The Halfhand believed our only chance to stop Mance was to get a man inside his army.
Don't talk about the Halfhand as if you knew him. He was my brother.,"Then you'd know he'd do anything to defend the Wall. The free folk would have boiled him alive, but letting me kill him..."
The free folk? Listen to him. He even talks like a wildling now.,"Aye, I talk like a wildling. I ate with the wildlings. I climbed the Wall with the wildlings. I... I laid with a wildling girl."
"You admit to breaking your vows, then?",I do.
There's a difference between sneaking off to the Mole's Town brothel and sleeping with the enemy.,"While we sit here debating which rules I broke, Mance Rayder marches on the Wall with an army of 100,000."
Impossible. You can't get 50 wildlings together before they start killing each other.,"100,000. He's united the Thenns, the Hornfoots, the ice-river clans. He has giants fighting for him."
Giants?,"Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser?"
"I commanded the City Watch of King's Landing, boy.",And now you're here. You must not have been very good at your job.
How dare you?!,There's a band of wildlings south of the Wall already led by Tormund Giantsbane. I killed their warg and three others. They shot me full of arrows. Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north. The signal for the attack will be a bonfire. Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen. That's the truth. All the truth.

Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen. That's the truth. All the truth.,Do you intend to execute me or am I free to go?
"You're a champion of the common people, Lord Snow. What do you say to Brother Pyp's proposition?","Mance Rayder is coming. If the wildlings breach the Wall, they'll roll over everything and everyone for 1,000 Miles before they reach an army that can stop them."
Rangers returning.,Help him.
We were guests of the mutineers at Craster's Keep.,And the mutineers stayed?
They're not going anywhere. They've got Craster's food and his wives. Poor girls. Never thought they'd miss their daddy. Karl's running things now. He's the one who put a knife through Craster's mouth.,We need to ride north and kill them all.
"We just went over this, boy. -Justice can wait.","It's not about justice. I told the wildlings we had over 1,000 men at Castle Black alone. Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do. How long do you think they'll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off? Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesn't know it yet. As soon as he gets his hands on them, he will. Then he'll throw his full strength at us. And even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings, there's still not a thing we can do to stop them."
Shh. Don't you worry yourself about all that. You just do what needs to be done.,Bring it through! And again.
Bring it through! And again.,Very nice. Good.
Very nice. Good.,A lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand. First thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds.
A lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand. First thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds.,Let's see what you can do.
Let's see what you can do.,"Olly, you just watch for now."
I can fight.,Have you ever held a sword before? OLLY I was the best archer in our hamlet.
"I believe you. We'll go hunting for rabbits one day. Right now, watch and learn.","You two. Take it slow, try and disarm each other."
"You two. Take it slow, try and disarm each other.",You know how to fight. You could have gone easier on him.
Lord Snow. What do you think you're doing?,Grenn and I were helping them.
"Grenn's a ranger.You're a steward. Maybe you forgot that while you were off with your wildling bitch, but I didn't.",Someone has to train them.
"A bastard, eh? Took you for highborn.",My father was highborn. My mother wasn't.
Name's Locke.,Jon Snow.
Jon Snow.,You fight well.
I should neverhave taken her away.,She wasn't safe here.
"She's not safe out there. I should have known. You told us there were wildlings south of the Wall. If they're raiding the smaller villages, Mole's Town could be next.",Castle Black could be next.
I should go back for Gilly.,We have orders. No one's to leave the castle.
I remember when you disobeyed orders and rode south to help Robb.,"And I remember who came after me and brought me home. I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me. When you told me about Bran going beyond the Wall, all I could think about was getting my strength back so I could go and find him."
"I wish I could have convinced him to come back with me. I tried. Really, I did.",How fast could they travel? A crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton?
I don't know. They'd pass wildling villages. They could try to find shelter at one of them.,The wildlings have joined up with Mance. Every village or sheltered place will be deserted. Except...
"Your foray to Craster's Keep, I'll sanction it. But I won't order anyone to go with you. Volunteers only.","Thank you, Ser Alliser."
"Thank you, Ser Alliser.","Ahem, brothers."
"Ahem, brothers.","I'm going beyond the Wallto Craster's Keep. I'm going to capture the mutineers holed up there or kill them. I'm asking for volunteers to come with me. There's 60 miles of wilderness between here and Craster's and Mance Rayder has an army bearing down on us, but we have to do this. Our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before Mance does. They know the Wall. They know our defenses. If Mance learns what they know, we're lost. But if that's not enough, then consider this. If the Night's Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father. He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men. Stabbed in the back by cowards. He deserved far better. All we can give him now is justice. Who will join me?"

"Then let me say my vows. If it's a fight you're heading for, then you need men who know how.","Thank you, brothers."
You do move quiet.,How many?
There's a hut on the west side of the keep. We should steer clear of it.,Why?
New moon tonight.,Get some rest. We move at sundown.
You.,Are you all right? Come with me. Come on.
Are you all right? Come with me. Come on.,We lost four brothers?
What the seven hells could do that to a man?,I count ten dead mutineers.
Jon.,Where in seven hells? Come here.
Where in seven hells? Come here.,"I missed you, boy."
What should we do with this lot?,It's not safe for you here on your own. Mance Rayder has an army heading this way and there's worse out there than Mance. Come with us to Castle Black. We can find you work. Keep you safe.
"Meaning all respect, Ser Crow, Craster beat us and worse. Your brother crows beat us and worse. We'll find our own way.",You want to stay here in Craster's Keep?
They return!,Greetings.
This is no place for wild beasts. Lock him away or I'll let Hobb throw him in tonight's stew.,"Come on, Ghost."
"Come on, Ghost.",Mance's army was closing in on Craster's Keep when we left. We saw their campfires from Osric's Hill. They'll reach the Wall before the next full moon.
"I'm surprised you didn't ride over and say hello. The King-beyond-the-Wall is your old friend, isn't he?",We need to prepare.
We've been preparing.,We should seal the tunnel. Plug it with rocks and ice. Flood it and let it freeze.
And how would we range north?,We wouldn't.
"This castle has stood for thousands of years. The Night's Watch has defended her for thousands of years. And in all those centuries, we have never sealed the tunnel.","Have you ever seen a giant, Ser Alliser? I have."
The bars on those gates are four inches thick. Cold-rolled steel.,They won't stop them.
"Remind me which order you belong to, Lord Snow.",The stewards.
Are the stewards responsible for maintaining the tunnel?,No.
Who would that be?,The builders.
I should never have left her there.,You couldn't have known.
We can't even guard Mole's Town.,"We can't go after them, you know that. That's what they want."
She might have.,"If they hit Mole's Town, then we're next. Mance's army must be close."
What was she like?,She...she had red hair.
Oh? How big were her feet?,Well what do you want me to say?
I want you to tell me what it was like to have someone. To be with someone. To love someone and have them love you back. We're all gonna die a lot sooner than I'd planned. You're the closest I'll ever get to know it.,So you and Gilly never-
No...she just had a baby! ...and she never offered.,"But if she had, you wouldo ve? You'd have broken your vows?"
"The interesting thing is, our vows never specifically forbid intimate relations with women.",What?
"I shall take no wife yes, that's in there, there's no denying that. I shall father no children it's very specific. But what our vows have to say about other...activities...is open to interpretation.",I don't think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation.
"Anyway, there's nothing for him to interpret. We didn't. So what's it like?","It's...there's this person, this whole other person. And you're wrapped up in them and they're wrapped up in you and...you...for a little...for a little while you're more than just you, you're...well I don't know, I'm not a bleedin' poet!"
"No, you're really not.",And what did I get for it? An arrow six inches from my heart.
There'll be arrows for all of us soon I imagine.,There will.
They've already done the worst thing to me they could ever do.,"Go get some sleep, Sam. I'll take this watch."
Pick up the pace!,"There we go, boys. That's one. There's two. Come on, let's get the next lot. That's the last of the oil, Ser Alliser."
A hundred thousand you say?,Yes sir.
You can say it if you like. We shouldo ve sealed the tunnel while we had the chance like you suggested.,"It was a difficult decision either way, Ser."
"No discipline. No training. Gang of thieves, that's all this is. I commanded the city watch of King's Landing. Those men obeyed orders.",We can't just let them attack the gate!
"The bars of those gates are four inches of cold, rolled steel.","Those are giants riding mammoths down there. Do you think your cold, rolled steel's gonna stop them?"
Needed below? Yes. Yes.,Archers! Knock your arrows! Draw! Loose!
Archers! Knock your arrows! Draw! Loose!,They won't summit before dawn.
How do you know that?,Because I've made that claim.
I think they're in a bigger hurry than you were.,Knock! Draw! Loose!
"You're alright. You're alright. I'll get help. Shh, shh. Maester Aemon is coming, he's gonna make it alright.",Now!
Now!,"to Grenn* The outer gate won't hold. Take five men, hold the inner gate."
Alright.,grabs Grenn's arm* Hold the gate. If they make it through...
"They won't. Come on Hill! And you Cooper! You three, on me! Come on you lazy bastards!",Oil!
"And find a weapon, Olly. Fight them!",What are you doing up here?
The Wildlings are over the walls. Ser Alliser has fallen. The castle walls can't stand much longer.,"Ed. You have The Wall. If they try the mammoths again, drop fire on them. If the climbers get too high, drop the scythe on them."
"Ed. You have The Wall. If they try the mammoths again, drop fire on them. If the climbers get too high, drop the scythe on them.",Two brothers now fight with me.
"And win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come!",to Sam* I don't want you out there.
You can't protect me forever. There won't be anywhere to hide if the castle falls.,I need him more than I need you.
Jon Snow.,"No, shh, don't talk."
We shouldo ve stayed in that cave.,We'll go back there.
Don't cheer too loud. They still outnumber us a thousand to one.,"Tormund. It's over, let it end."
This is how a man ends.,Put him in chains. We'll question him later.
I shouldo ve thrown you from the top of your wall boy!,"Aye, you shouldo ve."
We held them off.,For one night.
This is a great victory.,"Great victory? Mance was testing our defenses. He almost made it through. And he has more giants, he has more mammoths. He has a thousand times as many men. They'll hit us again tonight. Maybe we can hold them off for a day or two, but we can never beat them."
Where are you going?,I'm going to find Mance.
To...you can't do that. No one gave you any orders.,"Who's left to give orders? The Wildling army is only an army because of Mance. He united a hundred warring tribes. Without Mance they lose their leader. They lose their purpose, they go back to fighting each other, scatter back to their home."
Without Mance? You're going to kill him?,I'm going to try.
"They'll never let you within a hundred yards of him. And if you did, even if you managed to kill him.",He'll kill me. If I don't go he'll kill me anyway. They'll kill the rest of us too.
He won't just kill ya. They'll boil you. They'll filet you. They'll make it last days!,You're right. It's a bad plan. What's your plan?
You're right. It's a bad plan. What's your plan?,"They held the gate. Get some brothers down here to help you. You need to burn the bodies. Raise the outer gate, then lower it again as soon as I'm out."
What are you doing?,I promised Jeor I'd never lose it again. *he hands the sword to Sam* In case I don't come back.
You're wearing a black cloak again.,I've been sent to negotiate with you.
"It appears my trusting nature got the better of me. It's happened before. I was hoping your loyalty was real when you pledged yourself to us, Jon Snow, truly I was.","The Halfhand ordered me to join your army and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black. He made me kill him so you'd trust me. I was loyal, to him and to my Night's Watch vows."
"All of your vows? She wasn't enough to turn ya, eh? Were you enough to turn her?",She put three arrows in me when I escaped.
Did you see her again at Castle Black?,Yes.
And?,She's dead.
Your doing?,No.
Ygritte.,Ygritte.
Ygritte.,That's not wine.
"No, it's a proper Northern drink, Jon Snow. You did well. Fought hard. Killed some of our strongest men. One of our giants went into your tunnel and never came out again. Mag the Mighty.",He's dead. He killed my friend Grenn.
He was their king. Last of a bloodline that stretches back before the First Men.,Grenn came from a farm.
Mag and Grenn.,Grenn and Mag.
"Kullback, could I trouble you for something to eat? I don't imagine our guest has eaten anything in quite some time. So. You're here to strike a bargain?",Turn your army around and go home.
You know I know you're low on arrows. You're low on oil. You're low on men. How many are left? 50?,I told Tormund and Orell. We have more than a thousand men.
You attacking us?,"No, it's like you said, we don't have the men."
What are men of the Night's Watch doing in a Wildling camp?,I was sent to discuss terms with the king beyond the wall.
You're speaking to the one true king boy. You'll address him as your grace.,"I know he's the king. My father died for him. My name is Jon Snow, your grace. I'm Ned Stark's son."
Your father was an honorable man.,"He was, your grace."
What do you think he'd have done with him?,"I was this man's prisoner once. He couldo ve tortured me, he couldo ve killed me, but he spared my life. I think my father wouldo ve taken him prisoner, listened to what he had to say."
Very well. *to Davos* Take him.,"Your grace. If my father'd seen the things that I've seen, he'd also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall. All of them."
Your old blind man patched me up. Why?,"He's sworn to treat all wounded men, friend or foe."
You want me alive so you can torture me?,No one's going to torture you.
So how do we die? Hanging? Beheading? Drop us from the top of the wall?,I don't know what happens to the prisoners.
Who decides?,I suppose Stannis does.
He your king now?,I don't have a king.
"You spent too much time with us, Jon Snow. You can never be a kneeler again.",We're gonna burn the bodies of your dead. Do you want to say any words over them?
Words? What kind of words?,Funeral words. I don't know how the Free Folk do it.
Do what?,Say farewell.
Snow. Did you love her? She loved you.,She told you?
I do not know. I must go.,Get your shield up.
It's too heavy.,"If it wasn't heavy it wouldn't stop a sword, now get it up."
"If it wasn't heavy it wouldn't stop a sword, now get it up.",Come. Try it again. Drive at me. Keep your shield up. Or I'll ring your head like a bell.
"You can't leave, they'll execute you.","Good, good, pivot! Don't forget to pivot! Shield up!"
The king wants a word.,"You're not cold, my lady?"
Are you a virgin?,No.
You know who rules at Winterfell now?,Roose Bolton.
The traitor who plunged a dagger into Robb Stark's heart. Don't you want to avenge him?,"I want a great many things, your grace. But I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch now."
I've been talking to your sworn brothers. Many of them love you.,They're good men.
Many don't. You were seen taking the body of a wildling girl north of the Wall. Why?,It's where she belonged.
Some of the Night's Watch feel you have too much affection for the wildlings.,They were born on the wrong side of the wall. That doesn't make them monsters.
No matter. I shall take back the North from the thieves who stole it. Tywin Lannister is dead. He can't protect them now. I shall mount Roose Bolton's head on a spike. But if I'm to take Winterfell I'll need more men.,The men of the Night's Watch are sworn to play no part--
I'm not talking about the damn Night's Watch. I'm talking about the wildlings.,"Your grace, you want the wildlings to march in your army?"
I'll offer them their lives and their freedom if Mance kneels before me and swears his loyalty.,I don't think that's likely.
"You admire him, don't you?",I respect him.
He likes you. Convince him to bend the knee...,Your grace…
or he burns.,How much time do I have?
So here we are.,Here we are.
"When we first met you were my prisoner. And now, for our last meeting…",This doesn't have to be our last meeting.
"No, but it will be.",You know what Stannis wants?
He wants me to bend the knee. And he wants the free folk to fight for him. I'll give him this much,Shouldn't a king be bold?
"Oh, aye. I respect him. If he gets what he wants, I expect he'll be a better ruler than the fools sitting on the Iron Throne the last hundred years. But I'll never serve him.",You told me you weren't here to conquer. You told me your people have bled enough.
That's right. But I don't want them bleeding for Stannis Baratheon either.,"You spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together for the first time in history. Thenns and Hornfoots, the ice-river clans, even the giants. A life's work uniting them. You didn't do it for power. You didn't do it for glory. You brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter, not if they're north of the wall. Isn't their survival more important than your pride?"
Pride? Fuck my pride. This isn't about that.,Then bend the knee and save your people.
They followed me because they respected me. Because they believed in me. The moment I kneel for a Southern king that's all gone.,And how many tens of thousands are out there right now? How many women? How many children? And you won't go out and rescue them because why? You're afraid of looking afraid.
"Oh, I am afraid. No shame in that. How will they do it? Beheading? Hanging?",They'll burn you alive.
"Bad way to go. I'll be honest with you, I don't want to die. And burnt to death, I don't want people to remember me like that. Scorched and screaming. But it's better than betraying everything I believe.","And what happens to your people? You preserve your dignity and die standing, and they'll sing songs about you. “You'd rather burn than kneel. The great hero.” Until winter comes, and the white walkers come for us all, and there's no one left to sing."
"You're a good lad. Truly, you are. But if you can't understand why I won't enlist my people in a foreigner's war, there's no point explaining.",I think you're making a terrible mistake.
"I ordered Mance Rayder burnt at the stake. You prevented that order from being carried out. You showed mercy to Mance Rayder. A king's word is law. Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos how much mercy I show to lawbreakers. Show too much kindness, people won't fear you. If people don't fear you, they don't follow you.","With respect, Your Grace, the free folk will never follow you, no matter what you do. You're the man who burned their king alive."
Who then? You?,No. Only one of their own.
Do you know this wretched girl Lyanna Mormont?,The Lord Commander's niece.
"Lady of Bear Island, and a child of 10. I asked her to commit her house to my cause, that's her response.","Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark."
That amuses you?,"I apologize, Your Grace. Northerners can be a bit like the free folk. Loyal to their own."
"Tonight, the Night's Watch elect a new Lord Commander. Ser Alliser Thorne is going to win.",Most likely.
Unpleasant man. He thinks you're a traitor. What's your life going to be like on the Wall with Thorne in command?,"Unpleasant, I expect."
Your bravery made him look weak. He'll punish you for it. I don't punish men for bravery. I reward them.,"I don't doubt it, Your Grace. But I'm a brother of the Night's Watch. I've pledged them my life, my honor, my sword. I don't know what I have left to give you."
You can give me the North.,"I can't. Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard. A Snow."
He'll make you a Stark with the stroke of a pen?,"It's the first thing I ever remember wanting. I'd daydream that my father would ask the king, and just like that I would never be the bastard of Winterfell again."
You deserve this. You do. I couldn't be happier for you.,I'm going to refuse him.
But you'd be Lord of Winterfell.,"I swore a vow to the Night's Watch. If I don't take my own word seriously, what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be?"
Lord Commander.,Your Grace.
I'd like to speak alone.,"Olly is my steward now, as I was Lord Commander Mormont's. I want him to attend my meetings, to learn from men with experience. One day, he might command."
Very well. . Have you considered my offer?,I have. And I thank you for it. You do me great honor. All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.
Say the word and you will be.,But I have to refuse you. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. My place is here.
I'm giving you a chance to avenge your family. To take back the castle where you grew up. To rule the North.,"I wish I could fight beside you. Believe me, I do. But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood. I pledged my life to the Night's Watch."
You're as stubborn as your father. And as honorable.,I can imagine no higher praise.
"I didn't mean it as praise. Honor got your father killed. . But if your mindo s made up, I won't try to persuade you.","May I ask, Your Grace, how long you plan to stay at Castle Black?"
Are you bored of us already?,You saved us from Mance Rayder's army. We will never forget that. But it's a question of survival. The Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. Winter is coming.
I know it. We march on Winterfell within the fortnight. Before the snows trap us here.,And the wildlings?
"They'd rather burn than fight for me, so be it. I leave their fate to you. You could execute them, that's the safest course. . Or you could see if this Tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than Mance ever was. I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch would rather see the wildlings dead.","Most of the brothers, yes. There's little love for the free folk here. ."
You have many enemies in Castle Black. Have you considered sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere? Give him command of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.,I heard it was best to keep your enemies close.
"He sees something in you. . Might not be apparent from his tone, but it's the truth. He believes in you.",I'm sorry I disappointed him.
The king is a complicated man. But he wants what's right for the Seven Kingdoms.,As long as he's ruling them.
He's the one true king. He has the blood right to that throne.,I've sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms.
"Wait, that's enough. “The shield that guards the realm of men.” That's what you swore to be. Now I'm not a learned man, but the best way of helping the most people might not be sitting in a frozen castle at the edge of the world. It just might mean wading in the muck, getting your boots dirty, and doing what needs to be doing.",And what needs to be done?
"Welcome home, Lady Stark. The North remembers.",Sam. . Maester Aemon?
He apologizes for not being here. He's not feeling well.,"Take good care of him. . Brothers. As you all know too well, it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit. . First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task. . Brian. Seems like a good job for a ginger."
"Take good care of him. . Brothers. As you all know too well, it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit. . First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task. . Brian. Seems like a good job for a ginger.","Ser Alliser. . You have more experience than any other soldier at Castle Black. You proved your valour many times over, while defending the Wall from the wildling attack. I name you First Ranger."
"Ser Alliser. . You have more experience than any other soldier at Castle Black. You proved your valour many times over, while defending the Wall from the wildling attack. I name you First Ranger.",Lord Janos. I'm giving you command of Greyguard.
Greyguard is a ruin.,"Yes, the fort is in a sorry state. Restore it as best you can. First Builder Yarwyck can spare ten of his -"
"Alright, alright! Enough of that.","You mistake me, my Lord. That was a command, not an offer. Pack your arms and armour, say your farewells, and ride for Greyguard."
"I will not go meekly off to freeze and die! Give it to one of the fools who cast a stone for you. I will not have it. Do you hear me, boy? I will not have it!",Are you refusing to obey my order?
You can stick your order up your bastard arse.,Take Lord Janos outside.
Take Lord Janos outside.,"Olly, bring me my sword."
"A disgrace! I have friends, important friends in the capital! You'll see!","If you have any last words, my Lord, now is the time."
You think highly of this boy.,Good.
Lord Ashford. . Lady Caulfield. . Lord Smallwood.,Never even heard of these people.
They haven't heard of you either. . But we need men and they have some.,And how many men does this Lord Mazin have to send us?
More than Lord Wibberley.,Not him.
"I know, I'm sorry, but we need men and supplies. And Roose Bolton is the Warden of The North.",He murdered my brother.
Lord Commander.,How can I help you?
"Come with us when we ride south. . None of us know the castle as well as you do. Its hidden tunnels, its weaknesses, its people. Winterfell was your home once. Don't you want to chase the rats out of it? .",Castle Black is my home now. Night's Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.
There's only one war. Life against death. Come. Let me show what you're fighting for. .,"You're gonna show me some vision in the fire. Forgive me, my Lady. But I don't trust in visions."
"The Lord of Light made us male and female. Two parts of a greater whole. We are joining this power. Power to make life, power to make light, and power to cast shadows.",I don't think Stannis would like that very much.
Then we shouldn't tell him. .,I can't.
Why?,I swore a vow. . I loved another.
The dead don't need lovers. Only the living.,I know. But I still love her.
"A Targaryen, alone in the world, is a terrible thing.",Maester Aemon.
Lord Commander.,"Sam, I'd like to speak to the maester alone."
"Sam, I'd like to speak to the maester alone.",How are you feeling?
"Oh, like a hundred-year-old man slowly freezing to death.","I need your advice. There's something I want to do, something I have to do. But it'll divide the Night's Watch. Bitterly. Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order."
"Half the men hate you already, Lord Commander. Do it.",But you don't know what it is.
"That doesn't matter. You do. You will find little joy in your command. But with luck, you will find the strength to do what needs to be done. Kill the boy, Jon Snow. Winter is almost upon us. Kill the boy, and let the man be born.",Where are the rest of the free folk now? . Where have they gone? . Who leads them?
They followed Mance. They won't follow anyone else.,What about you?
Hard to lead when you're in chains.,What if I unchained you?
Why would you do that?,Because you are not my enemy. And I'm not yours.
You sure seemed like my enemy when you were killing my friends.,"For 8,000 years the Night's Watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the realms of men. And for 8,000 years we've fallen short of that oath. You belong to the realms of men. All of you."
And now everything is going to change?,It is.
Why now?,"Because now, , I am Lord Commander of the Night's Watch."
"What would you have me do, , Lord Commander?",I'd have you go north of the Wall. Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here. I'll open the gates for them and let them through. I'll find them lands to settle south of the Wall.
They won't kneel for you and neither will I.,I don't want them to kneel for me. I want them to fight with me when the time comes.
The day I ask my people to fight with the crows is the day my people cut my guts from my belly and make me eat them.,"And how many of your people can't fight? The women, the children, the old, the sick, what happens to them? You're condemning them to death. Worse than death because you're too proud to make peace. Or maybe you're not proud. Maybe you're just a coward."
Easy thing to say to a man in chains.,Your people need a leader. And they need to get south of the Wall before it's too late. We don't have much time and they have less. The walkers are coming and they'll hit your people first. I'm not asking you to make peace to save your skin. Make peace to save your people.
Most of them are at Hardhome. You know where that is?,Up on Storroldo s Point. I can give you 10 horses and nine other men. You can get there in a week.
We'll need ships.,I'll talk to King Stannis about lending you his fleet.
"You'd bring wildlings here, through our gates?","Men, women, and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing."
We've been fighting them all for thousands of years. They've slaughtered villages. They've slaughtered our brothers.,And we've slaughtered theirs.
"I will follow you anywhere, you know that. But they killed Grenn. And they killed Pyp. . They killed 50 of our brothers. I can't forget that. I can't forgive it.","You were at the Fist of the First Men. If we abandon them, you know what they become. We can learn to live with the wildlings or we can add them to the army of the dead. Whatever they are now, they're better than that."
"You were at the Fist of the First Men. If we abandon them, you know what they become. We can learn to live with the wildlings or we can add them to the army of the dead. Whatever they are now, they're better than that.","Thank you. . Olly. . If you have something you want to say to me, say it. It's all right."
"You don't mean it, do you? Telling the wildlings you want to make peace. You're just doing it to trick them.",It's not a trick.
"They burned my village. They put an arrow through my father's head right in front of me. They butchered my mother, everyone I ever knew.",I know what it's like to lose the people you love. I know this is hard for you. But winter is coming. We know what's coming with it. We can't face it alone.
"Will there be anything else you need, Lord Commander?",No.
I hope you know what you're doing with these wildlings. I need those ships.,"You'll get them back, I swear it. Have a safe journey, Your Grace. And thank you."
EPISODE,"First Ranger, you have command of Castle Black."
"Lord Commander, it is my duty to tell you I believe this mission to be reckless, foolhardy, and an insult to all of the Brothers that have died fighting the wildlings.","As always, thank you for your honesty."
"Safe travels, Lord Commander.","Thank you, Sam."
It's Dragonglass. It's what I used to kill the White Walker. I hope you don't need them.,Me too.
You trust me Jon Snow?,Does that make me a fool?
Why aren't you in chains?,He's not my prisoner.
What is he?,We're allies.
I don't fight for the crows.,We're not here to fight. We're here to talk.
Gather the elders and let's talk.,My name's Jon Snow. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. We're not friends. We've never been friends. We won't become friends today. This isn't about friendship. This is about survival. This is about putting a 700 foot wall between you and what's out there.
Since when do the crows give 2 shits if we live?,In normal times we wouldn't. But these aren't normal times. The white walkers don't care if a man's Free Folk or Crow. We're all the same to them. Meat to their army. But together we can beat them.
"Beat the white walkers? Good luck with that. Run from them, maybe.",It's not a trick. It's a gift for those who join us.
It's not a trick. It's a gift for those who join us.,Dragonglass. A man of the Night's Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker.
You saw this?,No. But I trust the man.
And with the things we've seen you don't believe them?,Come with me and I'll share these weapons.
Come with you where?,There are good lands south of the wall. The Night's Watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands.
There are good lands south of the wall. The Night's Watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands.,"I knew Mance Rayder. He never wanted a war with the Night's Watch, he wanted a new life for his people. For you. We're prepared to give you that new life."
If…?,If you swear you join us when the real war begins.
Where is Mance?,He died.
How?,I put an arrow through his heart.
"I lost my father, my uncle, and 2 brothers fighting the damn crows.","I'm not asking you to forget your dead. I'll never forget mine. I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the wall. But I'm asking you to think about your children now. They'll never have children of their own if we don't band together. The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it. No clan can stop them. The free folk can't stop them. The Night's Watch can't stop them. And all the southern kings can't stop them. Only together, all of us, and even then it might not be enough, but at least then we'll give the fuckers a fight."
I fucking hate Thenns.,How many are with us? 5000?
I'm not good at counting.,We're leaving too many behind.
The free folk are stubborn. You know how long it took Mance to band them together. 20 fucking years.,And he knew them better than I ever will.
Ready your arrows!,Get in line! Get in line!
Get in line! Get in line!,Hold the line! Hold the line!
Lord Commander!,Get them to the ship and come back for me!
But you'll never make it--,Now!
Now!,You should be on one of those boats.
So should you ! My little girl has gone on. They're gonna let them pass the wall even if you're not there ?,You have my word. I've given orders.
"If they get through, everyone dies !",Night's Watch with me! Move! Move! Move!
Night's Watch with me! Move! Move! Move!,The Dragonglass!
Fuck the glass! We're gonna die here.,Go! Go! Go!
"Wun Wun, to the sea.",Let's go now! Now!
Open the gates.,It was a failure.
It wasn't.,"I went to save them, I failed."
"You didn't fail him, or him, or her. Every one of them is alive because of you, and no one else.",I don't think that fact's lost on them.
Three coppers.,Here's a silver because the lady likes you.
Get the men into marching formation. On to Winterfell.,"He raised his hands. And they all stood up at once. Tens of thousands of them, the biggest army in the world."
So what are you gonna do?,I'm gonna hope they don't learn how to climb the wall.
But… the Dragonglass?,"No one's ever getting that back, now. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, unless we had a mountain of it."
But… you killed a White Walker.,With Longclaw. I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass. But Longclaw…
He's made of Valyrian steel. How many Valyrian steel swords are left in the Seven Kingdoms?,Not enough. The first Lord Commander in history to sacrifice the lives of sworn Brothers to save the lives of Wildlings. How's it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black?
You were friends with me when I first got here. And I wasn't winning any elections back then.,Here's to us then. Long may they sneer.
Here's to us then. Long may they sneer.,What?
"I wanted to ask you something. To ask something of you. Send me, Gilly, and the baby to Oldtown so I can become a Maester. That's what I'm meant to be, not this.","I need you here, Sam. If you leave, who's left to give me advice I trust?"
Thank you.,"You know that The Citadel will make you swear off women, too."
They'll bloody try.,Sam?
What?,Sam…
Sam…,You've just been beaten half to death. How did you--
Very carefully.,I'm glad the end of the worldo s working out for someone.
I'll come back.,To your return.
He came to your aid. Stannis. Now he needs you!,We don't have enough men to make any difference.
The wildlings will make a difference!,"The wildlings won't ever fight for Stannis, I told you before--"
"You saved their bloody lives. If they're going to live in the Seven Kingdoms, safe behind our wall, they ought to fight for the damn place.",It's not their fight!
It's not their fight!,Stannis?
Lord Commander. It's one of the wildlings you brought back. Says he knows your Uncle Benjen. Says he's still alive.,Are you sure he's talking about Benjen?
Man says he saw your uncle at Hardhome the last full moon.,He could be lying.
Could be. There are ways to find out.,Where is he?
For the Watch.,Olly…
What do you remember?,They stabbed me Olly...he put a knife in my heart I shouldn't be here
"Afterwards, after they stabbed you, after you died, where did you go? What did you see?",Nothing There was nothing at all
"You were dead And now you're not That's completely fucking mad, seems to me I can only imagine how it seems to you",I did what I thought was right And I got murdered for it And now I'm back Why?
I don't know Maybe we'll never know What does it matter? You go on You fight for as long as you can You clean up as much of the shit as you can,"I don't know how to do that I thought I did, but...I failed"
They think you're some kind of god The man who returned from the dead,I'm not a god
Your eyes are still brown Is that still you in there?,I think so Hold off on burning my body for now
It's time,"If you have any last words, now is the time"
You shouldn't be alive It's not right,Neither was killing me
"I had a choice, Lord Commander Betray you or betray the Night's Watch You brought an army of wildlings into our lands An army of muderers and raiders If I had to do it all over knowing where I'd end up, I pray I'd make the right choice again","I'm sure you would, Ser Alliser"
We should burn the bodies,You should
What do you want me to do with this?,Wear it Burn it Whatever you want You have Castle Black
Wear it Burn it Whatever you want You have Castle Black,My watch is ended
Where you gonna go?,South
What are you gonna do?,Get warm
I was with you at Hardhome We saw what's out there We know it's coming here How can you leave us now?,I did everything I could You know that
You swore a vow,"Aye, I pledged my life to the Night's Watch I gave my life"
For all nights to come,"They killed me, Edd! My own brothers You want me to stay here after that?"
This is good soup Do you remember those kidney pies Old Nan used to make?,With the peas and onions?
Mmm,We never should have left Winterfell
"Don't you wish we could go back to the day we left? I want to scream at myself, “Don't go, you idiot”",How could we know?
I spent a lot of time thinking about what as ass I was to you I wish I could change everything,We were children
"I was awful, just admit it",You were occasionally awful I'm sure I can't have been great fun Always sulking in the corner while the rest of you played
Can you forgive me?,There's nothing to forgive
Forgive me,"All right All right, I forgive you"
"All right All right, I forgive you","You'd think after thousands of years, the Night's Watch would have learned how to make a good ale"
Where will you go?,"Where will we go? If I don't watch over you, Father's ghost will come back and murder me"
Where will we go?,"I can't stay here, not after what happened"
There's only one place we can go Home,Should we tell the Boltons to pack up and leave?
We'll take it back from them,I don't have an army
How many wildlings did you save?,They didn't come here to serve me
You think they'll be safe here if Roose Bolton remains Warden of the North?,Sansa
"Winterfell is our home It's ours and Arya's and Bran's and Rickon's Wherever they are, it belongs to our family We have to fight for it",I'm tired of fighting
I'm tired of fighting,It's all I've done since I left home I've killed brothers of the Night's Watch I've killed wildlings I've killed men that I admire I hanged a boy younger than Bran I fought and I lost
"A letter for you, Lord Commander.",I'm not Lord Commander anymore.
I'm not Lord Commander anymore.,SNOW takes the letter. The man leaves. JON SNOW sees the seal of House Bolton. He opens the scroll and starts reading.
SNOW takes the letter. The man leaves. JON SNOW sees the seal of House Bolton. He opens the scroll and starts reading.,"To the traitor and bastard Jon Snow. You allowed thousands of wildlings past the Wall. You have betrayed your own kind. You have betrayed the North. Winterfell is mine, bastard. Come and see. Your brother Rickon is in my dungeon."
"To the traitor and bastard Jon Snow. You allowed thousands of wildlings past the Wall. You have betrayed your own kind. You have betrayed the North. Winterfell is mine, bastard. Come and see. Your brother Rickon is in my dungeon.",SNOW looks at SANSA.
SNOW looks at SANSA.,"His direwolf's skin is on my floor. Come and see. I want my bride back. Send her to me, bastard, and I will not trouble you or your wildling lovers. Keep her from me and I will ride north and slaughter every wildling man, woman, and babe living under your protection. You will watch as I skin them living. You --"
Go on.,It's just more of the same.
It's just more of the same.,"SNOW puts the letter away, but SANSA takes it and continues reading."
"You will watch as my soldiers take turns raping your sister. You will watch as my dogs your wild little brother. Then I will spoon your eyes from their sockets and let my dogs do the rest. Come and see. Ramsay Bolton, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.",Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.
His father's dead. Ramsay killed him. And now he has Rickon.,We don't know that.
"I heard him say 5,000 once when he was talking about Stannis's attack.",How many do you have?
A monster has taken our home and our brother. We have to go back to Winterfell and save them both.,SNOW nods.
No.,"We can't defend the north from the Walkers and the south from the Boltons. If we want to survive, we need Winterfell, and to take Winterfell, we need more men."
"They may well be loyal, but how many rose up against the Boltons when they betrayed your family? I may not know the North, but I know men. They're more or less the same in any corner of the world and even the bravest of them don't want to see their wives and children skinned for a lost cause. If Jon's going to convince them to fight alongside him, they need to believe it's a fight they can win.","There are more than three other houses in the North -- Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn, Mazin, Hornwood. Two dozen more. Together they equal all the others. We can start small and build."
My uncle the Blackfish has reformed it and retaken Riverrun.,How do you know that?
Then why did you lie to him when he asked you how you learned about Riverrun?,New dress?
I made it myself. Do you like it?,"Year, it's -- I like the wolf bit."
I made it like the one Father used to wear. As near as I can remember.,"Thank you, Sansa."
You're welcome.,Don't knock it down while I'm gone.
"Remember Mance's camp? It stretched all the way to the horizon. And look at us now. Look what's left of us. And if we lose this, we're gone. Dozens of tribes, hundreds of generations. Be like we were never there at all. We'll be the last of the free folk.","That's what'll happen to you if we lose. The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers, they know you're here. They know that more than half of you are women and children. After they finish with me, they'll come for you. You're right. This isn't your fight. You shouldn't have to come to Winterfell with me. I shouldn't be asking you. It's not the deal we made. I need you with me if we're gonna beat them, and we need to beat them if you're going to survive."
Snow.,Are you sure they'll come?
You've got one hand. My money's on the old boy.,Lady Mormont.
"I doubt it. My mother wasn't a great beauty or any other kind of beauty. She was a great warrior, though. She died fighting for your brother, Robb.","I served under your uncle at Castle Black, Lady Lyanna. He was also a great warrior and an honorable man. I was his steward. In fact- -"
I think we've had enough small talk. What are you here?,Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black before he marched on Winterfell and was killed. He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men. It said- -
I remember what it said. “Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark.”,"Robb is gone, but House Stark is not. And it needs your support now more than ever. I've come with my sister to ask for House Mormont's allegiance."
"If you say so. In any case, you don't just want my allegiance. You want my fighting men.","Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell, my lady. It is our duty to stop him. Even more so because he holds our brother Rickon Stark as prisoner. What you have to understand, my lady, is that- -"
Is this true?,Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men. I fought them at Hardhome. We both lost.
"House Mormont has kept faith with House Stark for 1,000 years. We will not break faith today.","Thank you, my lady. How many fighting men can we expect?"
62.,62?
The answer is no.,"Lord Glover, if you could just hear us out."
I've heard enough. We've only just taken back this castle from the Ironborn. The Boltons helped us do it. Now you want me to fight against them? I could be skinned for even talking to you.,The Boltons are traitors. Roose Bolton- -
Have other northern houses pledged to fight for you?,House Mormont.
And?,We sent raven to Houses Manderly- -
I don't care about ravens. You're asking me to join your army. Who is fighting in this army?,The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings.
Then the rumors are true. I didn't dare believe them. I received you out of respect for your father. Now I would like you to leave. House Glover will not abandon its ancestral home to fight alongside wildlings.,Lord Glover.
He was the most experienced commander in Westeros. He chose this place for a reason. Those mountains are a natural fortification. There's a stream down there for the horses.,We're not staying here long. Another storm could hit any day..
"Aye, the snows defeated Stannis as much as the Boltons did.",We have to march on Winterfell now while we still can.
So he's your most trusted advisor now? Because he secured 62 men from a ten year old?,Ser Davos is the reason I'm standing here talking to you and he served Stannis for years.
It's not enough. We need more men.,There's no time.
"If we went down to Castle Cerwyn, I know that Lord- -",We fight with the army we have.
"Tell your people what happened here. Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty. When they come forward with notions of retribution or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory, remind the what happened when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen.",You don't have to be here.
"Thank you for returning Lady Bolton safely. Now, dismount and kneel before me, surrender your army and proclaim me the true Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. I will pardon you for deserting the Night's Watch. I will pardon these treasonous lords for betraying my house. Come, bastard, you don't have the men, you don't have the horses, and you don't have Winterfell. Why lead those pour souls into slaughter? There's no need for a battle. Get off your hose and kneel. I'm a man of mercy.",You're right. There's no need for a battle. Thousands of men don't need to die. Only one of us. Let's end this the old way. You against me.
"I keep hearing stories about you, bastard. The way people in the North talk about you, you're the greatest swordsman who ever walked. Maybe you are that good. Maybe not. I don't know if I'd beat you. But I know that my army will beat yours. I have 6,000 men. You have, what, half that? Not even?","Aye, you have the numbers. Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldn't fight for them?"
"She's a fine woman, your sister. I look forward to having her back in my bed. And you're all fine-looking men. My dogs are desperate to meet you. I haven't fed them for seven days. They're ravenous. I wonder which parts they'll try first. Your eyes? Your balls? We'll find out soon enough. In the morning, then, bastard.","If he was smart, he'd stay inside the walls of Winterfell and wait us out."
"That's not his way. He knows the North is watching. If the other houses sense weakness on his part, they'll stop fearing him. He can't have that. Fear is his power.","It's his weakness, too. His mean don't want to fight for him. They're forced to fight for him. If they feel the tide turning..."
You and Stannis cut through us like piss through snow.,"We're digging trenches all along our flanks. They won't be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you, in a double envelopment."
stares blankly at JON SNOW.,A pincer move.
A pincer move.,They won't be able to hit us from the sides.
Did you really think that cunt would fight you man to man?,No. But I wanted to make him angry. I want him coming at us full tilt.
"So you've met the enemy, drawn up your battle plans.","Aye, for what they're worth."
"You've known him for the space of a single conversation, you and your trusted advisors, and you sit around and make your plans on how to defeat a man you don't know. I lived with him. I know the way his mind works. I know how he likes to hurt people. Did it ever once occur to you that I might have some insight?",You're right.
You think he's going to fall into your trap. He won't He's the one who lays traps.,He's overconfident.
He plays with people. He's far better at it than you. He's been doing it all his life.,"Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks? I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton. I've defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton."
You don't know him.,"All right, tell me. What should we do? How do we get Rickon back?"
"We'll never get him back. Rickon is Ned Starks trueborn son, which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay than you, a bastard, or me, a girl. As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim to Winterfell will be contested, which means he won't live long.",We can't give up on our brother.
"Listen to me, please. He wants you to make a mistake.",Of course he does. What should I do differently?
I don't know! I don't know anything about battles! Just don't do what he wants you to do.,"Aye, that's good advice."
You think that's obvious?,"Well, it is a bit obvious."
"If you had asked for my advice earlier, I would have told you not to attack Winterfell until we have a larger force, or is that obvious, too?",When will we have a larger force?! We've pleaded with every house that'll have us! The Blackfish can't help us! We're lucky to have this many men!
It's not enough!,"Now, it's not enough! It's what we have! Battles have been won against greater odds."
"If Ramsay wins, I'm not going back there alive. Do you understand me?","SNOW I won't ever let him touch you again. I'll protect you, I promise."
Happy shitting.,My lady. You weren't at the war council.
I'm not a soldier.,Any advice?
Don't lose.,"If I do, if I fall, don't bring me back."
I'll have to try.,I'm ordering you not to bring me back.
"I am not your servant, Jon Snow.",You're in my camp. I'm the commander.
I serve the Lord of Light. I do what he commands.,How do you know what he commands?
"I interpret his signs as well as I can. If the Lord didn't want me to bring you back, how did I bring you back? I have no power. Only what he gives me and he gave me you.",Why?
I don't know. Maybe you're only needed for this small part of his plan and nothing else. Maybe he brought you here to die again.,What kind of god would do something like that?
Loose!,Get word --
I've reconsidered. I think that sounds like a wonderful idea.,We're going to bury my brother in the crypt next to my father.
No women or children!,"When we had feasts, our family would sit up here… and I'd sit down there."
"Could have been worse, Jon Snow. You had a family. You had feasts.","Aye, you're right. I was luckier than most."
"Aye, you're right. I was luckier than most.",What is that?
I ask your leave to execute this woman for murder. She admits to the crime.,Do you have anything to say for yourself?
"I've been ready to die for many years. If the Lord was done with me, so be it, but he's not. You've seen the Night King, Jon Snow. You know the great war is still to come. You know the army of the dead will be upon us soon. And you know I can help you win that war.","Ride south today. If you return to the North, I'll have you hanged as a murderer."
"If you ever come back this way, I will execute you myself.",I'm having the lordo s chamber prepared for you.
Mother and Father's room? You should take it.,I'm not a Stark.
You are to me.,You're the Lady of Winterfell. You deserve it. We're standing here because of you. The battle was lost until the Knights of the Vale rode in. They came because of you. You told me Lord Baelish sold you to the Boltons.
He did.,And you trust him?
"Only a fool would trust Littlefinger. I should have told you about him, about the Knights of the Vale. I'm sorry.",We need to trust each other. We can't fight a war amongst ourselves. We have so many enemies now.
A raven came from the Citadel. A white raven. Winter is here.,"Well, Father always promised, didn't he?"
Not by me.,"The free folk, the northerners, and the Knights of the Vale fought bravely, fought together, and we won. My father uses to say we find our true friends on the battlefield."
"The Boltons are defeated. The war is over. Winter has come. If the maesters are right, it'll be the coldest one in a thousand years. We should ride home and wait out the coming storms.","The war is not over. And I promise you, friend, the true enemy won't wait out the storm. He brings the storm."
I did not fight beside you on the field and I will regret that until my dying day. A man can only admit when he was wrong and ask forgiveness.,"There's nothing to forgive, my lord."
"Okay, come on. Let's get them inside.","I want every northern maester to scour their records for any mention of dragonglass. Dragonglass kills white walkers. It's more valuable to us now than gold. We need to find it, we need to mine it, we need to make weapons from it. Everyone aged 10 to 60 will drill daily with spears, pikes, bow and arrow."
It's about time we taught these boys of summer how to fight.,Not just the boys.
Not just the boys.,We can't defend the North if only half the population is fighting.
"We'll begin training every man, woman, boy, and girl on Bear Island.","While we're preparing for attack, we need to shore up our defenses. The only thing standing between us and the Army of the Dead is the Wall and the Wall hasn't been properly manned in centuries. I'm not the king of the Free Folk."
"While we're preparing for attack, we need to shore up our defenses. The only thing standing between us and the Army of the Dead is the Wall and the Wall hasn't been properly manned in centuries. I'm not the king of the Free Folk.",But if we're going to survive this winter together...
You want us to man the castles for you?,Last time we saw the Night King was at Hardhome. The closest castle to Hardhome is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
Then that's where I'll go. Looks like we're the Night's Watch now.,"If they breach the wall, the first two castles in their path are Last Hearth and Karhold."
Aye!,The Umbers and the Karstarks have fought beside the Starks for centuries. They've kept faith for generation after generation.
And then they broke faith.,I'm not going to strip these families of their ancestral homes because of the crimes of a few reckless sons.
So there's no punishment for treason and no reward for loyalty?,The punishment for treason is death. Smalljon Umber died on the field of battle. Harald Karstark died on the field of battle.
They died fighting for Ramsay. Give the castles to the families of the men who died fighting for you.,"When I was Lord Commander of the Night's Watch I executed men who betrayed me. I executed men who refused to follow orders. My father always said, The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword, and I have tried to live by those words. But I will not punish a son for his father's sins, and I will not take a family home away from a family it has belonged to for centuries. That is my decision, and my decision is final."

But I will not punish a son for his father's sins, and I will not take a family home away from a family it has belonged to for centuries. That is my decision, and my decision is final.",Ned Umber.
Ned Umber.,Alys Karstark.
Alys Karstark.,"For centuries, our families fought side by side on the battlefield. I ask you to pledge your loyalty once again to House Stark, to serve as our bannermen and come to our aid whenever called upon."
"For centuries, our families fought side by side on the battlefield. I ask you to pledge your loyalty once again to House Stark, to serve as our bannermen and come to our aid whenever called upon.",Stand.
Stand.,"Yesterday's wars don't matter anymore. The North needs to band together, all the living north. Will you stand beside me, Ned and Alys, now and always?"
Now and always!,"You are my sister, but I am king now."
Will you start wearing a crown?,"When you question my decisions in front of the other lords and ladies, you undermine me."
So I can't question your decisions anymore?,"Of course you can, but--"
Joffrey never let anyone question his authority. You think he was a good king?,Do you think I'm Joffrey?
You're as far from Joffrey as anyone I've ever met.,Thank you.
"You're good at this, you know.",At what?
At ruling.,No.
Why are you laughing?,What did father used to say? Everything before the word but is horse shit.
He never said that to me.,"No. No, he never cursed in front of his girls."
"Because he was trying to protect us. He never wanted us to see how dirty the world really is, but Father couldn't protect me and neither can you. Stop trying.","All right, I'll stop trying to protect you and you stop trying to undermine me."
"You have to be smarter than Father. You need to be smarter than Robb. I loved them, I miss them, but they made stupid mistakes, and they both lost their heads for it.",And how should I be smarter? By listening to you?
"A raven from King's Landing, Your Grace.","Cersei of House Lannister, First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms--"
What does she want?,Come to King's Landing. Bend the knee or suffer the fate of all traitors.
"You've been so consumed with the enemy to the north, you've forgotten about the one to the south.","I'm consumed with the Night King because I've seen him. And believe me, you'd think of little else if you had, too."
We still have a wall between us and the Night King. Theres nothing between us and Cersei.,There's a thousand miles between us and Cersei. Winter is here. The Lannisters are a southern army. They've never ranged this far north.
"You're the military man, but I know her. If you're her enemy, she'll never stop until she's destroyed you. Everyone who's ever crossed her, she's found a way to murder.",You almost sound as if you admire her.
Do you think it's really Tyrion? It could be someone trying to lure you into a trap.,Read the last bit.
All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes. What does that mean?,It's something he said to me the first night we met. You know him better than any of us. What do you think?
"Sounds like a charmer. Of course, the casual mention of a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied and three dragons, a bit less charming.",What?
"No, too dangerous.",But?
"No, I won't. I'm like you, Ary. I'm a survivor.",Come in.
"A raven, My King, from the Citadel.",This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarley. He was my brother at the Night's Watch. A man I trust as much as anyone in this world. He's discovered proof that Dragonstone sits on a mountain of Dragonglass.
This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarley. He was my brother at the Night's Watch. A man I trust as much as anyone in this world. He's discovered proof that Dragonstone sits on a mountain of Dragonglass.,I received this a few days ago from Dragonstone. It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.
I received this a few days ago from Dragonstone. It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.,"He's now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen. She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister. She has a powerful army at her back and if this message is to be believed, three dragons."
"He's now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen. She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister. She has a powerful army at her back and if this message is to be believed, three dragons.",Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys and I'm going to accept.
Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys and I'm going to accept.,"We need this Dragonglass, My Lords. We know that Dragonglass can destroy both White Walkers and their army. We need to mine it and turn it into weapons."
"We need this Dragonglass, My Lords. We know that Dragonglass can destroy both White Walkers and their army. We need to mine it and turn it into weapons.","But more importantly, we need allies. The Night King's army grows larger by the day. We can't defeat them on our own. We don't have the numbers. Daenerys has her own army and she has dragon fire. I need to try and persuade her to fight with us. Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow, then sail for Dragonstone."
Have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather? The Mad King invited him to King's Landing and roasted him alive.,I know that.
"She is here to reclaim the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms. The north is one of those seven kingdoms. This isn't an invitation, it's a trap.","It could be, but I don't believe Tyrion would do that. You know him. He's a good man."
"Winter is here, Your Grace. We need the King in the North in the north.","You all crowned me your king. I never wanted it, I never asked for it, but I accepted it because the north is my home. It's part of me and I will never stop fighting for it, no matter the odds. But the odds are against us. None of you have seen the Army of the Dead. None of you. We can never hope to defeat them alone. We need allies, powerful allies. I know it's a risk. But I have to take it."
Then send an emissary. Don't go yourself.,Daenerys is a queen. Only a king can convince her to help us. It has to be me.
You're abandoning your people. Your abandoning your home.,I'm leaving both in good hands.
Whose?,"Yours. You are my sister. You are the only Stark in Winterfell. Until I return, the north is yours."
"I was sorry when he died. Your father and I had our differences but he loved Cat very much. So did I. She wasn't fond of you, was she? Well, it appears she vastly underestimated you. Your father and brothers are gone, yet here you stand King in the North. Last best hope against the coming storm.",You don't belong down here.
Forgive me. We have never talked properly. I wanted to remedy that.,I have nothing to say to you.
"Not even thank you? If it weren't for me you'd have been slaughtered at that battlefield. You have many enemies, My King, but I swear to you I'm not one of them. I love Sansa as I loved her mother.",Touch my sister and I'll kill you myself.
The bastard of Winterfell.,The dwarf of Casterly Rock.
I believe we last saw each other on top of the wall.,"You were pissing off the edge, if I remember right. You picked up some scars along the road."
Welcome to Dragonstone. Our queen knows this is a long journey. She appreciates the effort you have made on her behalf. If you wouldn't mind handing over your weapons.,Of course.
"And Sansa, I hear she's alive and well.",She is.
A sham marriage and unconsummated.,I didn't ask --
"Well, it was. It wasn't. Anyway, she's much smarter than she lets on.",She's starting to let on.
Good. At some point I want to hear how a Knight's Watch recruit became King in the North.,As long as you tell me how a Lannister became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen.
"A long and bloody tale. To be honest, I was drunk for most of it.",My bannermen think I'm a fool for coming here.
"Of course they do. If I was your hand I would have advised against it. General rule of thumb, Stark men don't fare well when they travel south.",True. But I'm not a Stark.
"Thank you for traveling so far, My Lords. I hope the seas weren't too rough.","The winds were kind, Your Grace."
"Forever. So I assume, My Lord, that you're here to bend the knee.",I am not.
"Oh. Well, that is unfortunate. You've travelled all this way to break faith with House Targaryen?",Break faith? Your father burned my grandfather alive. He burned my uncle alive. He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms.
"My father was an evil man. On behalf of House Targaryen I ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family. And I ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father. Our two houses were allies for centuries. Those were the best centuries the kingdom's ever known. Centuries of peace and prosperity with the Targaryens sitting on the Iron Throne and a Stark serving as Warden of the North. I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow. Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine. Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North. Together we will save this country from those who would destroy it.",You're right. You're not guilty of your father's crime. And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows.
Then why are you here?,Because I need your help and you need mine.
Did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?,I did.
"And did you see the Dothraki, all of whom have sworn to kill for me?",They're hard to miss.
Almost.,But you haven't stormed King's Landing. Why not? The only reason I can see is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people. It's the fastest way to win the war but you won't do it. Which means at the very least you're better than Cersei.
"Still, that doesn't explain why I need your help.","Because right now you and I and Cersei and everyone else, we're children playing at a game screaming that the rules aren't fair."
I believe he's calling all of us children. Figure of speech.,"Your Grace, everone you know will die before winter is over if we don't defeat the enemy to the north."
"As far as I can see, you are the enemy to the north.",I am not your enemy. The dead are the enemy.
Is that another figure of speech?,The Army of the Dead is on the march.
The Army of the Dead?,"You don't know me well, My Lord, but do you think I am a liar or a madman?"
"No, I don't think you're either of those things.",The Army of the Dead is real. The White Walkers are real. The Knight King is real. I've seen them. If they get past the wall and we're squabbling amongst ourselves --
The Army of the Dead is real. The White Walkers are real. The Knight King is real. I've seen them. If they get past the wall and we're squabbling amongst ourselves --,we're finished.
They did for me. I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms. And I will.,You'll be ruling over a graveyard if we don't defeat the Night King.
Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys. Help her to defeat my sister and together our armies will protect the north.,There's no time for that. There's no time for any of this. While we stand here debating --
It takes no time to bend the knee. Pledge your sword to her cause.,And why would I do that?
And why would I do that?,"I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I don't know you. As far as I can tell your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name. And my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King. The lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them. And I will continue to do so as well as I can."
You must forgive my manners. You will both be tired after your long journey. We'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms.,Am I your prisoner?
I came out here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack. You're making it difficult. You look a lot better brooding than I do. You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing.,I'm a prisoner on this island.
"I wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island. You're free to walk the castle, the beaches, to go wherever you want.",Except to my ship. They took my ship.
I wouldn't say we took your ship.,I'm not playing word games with you. The dead are coming for us all.
"Why don't you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies, and I'll figure out what to do about your walking dead men.",It's hard for me to fathom. It really is. If someone told me about the White Walkers and the Night King --
It's hard for me to fathom. It really is. If someone told me about the White Walkers and the Night King --,You probably don't believe me.
I do actually.,You didn't before. Grumpkins and snarks you called them. Do you remember? You said it was all nonsense.
"It was all nonsense. Everybody knew it. But then Mormont saw them and you saw them, and I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows.",How do I convince people who don't know me that an enemey they don't believe in is coming to kill them all?
Good question.,I know it's a good question. I'm looking for an answer.
"People's minds aren't made for problems that large. White Walkers, the Night King, Army of the Dead, it's almost a relief to confront a familiar monster like my sister.",I need to help prepare my people for what's coming. I can't help them from here. I'd like to leave.
It seems unlikely that you became King in the North by giving up that easily.,"Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes. Don't go south. Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter, a foreign invader. And here I am. A northern fool."
So do you have anything reasonable to ask?,What do you mean?
You must allow them their flights of fancy. It's dreary in the north.,Amazing thing to see.
People thought dragons were gone forever but here they are. Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know.,You've been talking to Tyrion?
He is my Hand.,He enjoys talking.
We all enjoy what we're good at.,I don't.
You know I'm not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.,I never expected that you would.
And I haven't changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to the throne.,I haven't either.
I will allow you to mine the Dragonglass and forge weapons from it. Any resources or men you need I will provide for you.,Thank you.
Thank you.,So you believe me then about the Night King and the Army of the Dead?
Many things?,Your Grace.
descends the stairs with MISSANDEI and they begin walking with JON. They walk along the beach until they reach a cave. DAVOS is waiting for them with a lit torch.,I wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits.

is looking up at the walls of Dragonglass.,"There is something else I want to show your, Your Grace."
"There is something else I want to show your, Your Grace.",and DAENERYS go to a further chamber in the cave. There are murals painted on the walls of Dragonglass.
and DAENERYS go to a further chamber in the cave. There are murals painted on the walls of Dragonglass.,The Children of the Forest made these.
When?,A very long time ago.
They were right here standing where we're standing before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters. Maybe even before there were men.,No.
stops looking at the walls and turns to look at JON. JON walks to another wall and begins to examine the murals. The murals depict Children of the Forest and the First Men standing together.,They were here together the Children and the First Men.
Doing what? Fighting each other?,takes DAENERYS by the arm and swings her torch to another part of the wall. There is a mural of the Night King and White Walkers.
"They fought together against their common enemy. Despite their differences, despite their suspicions, together. We need to do the same if we're going to survive.",and DAENERYS look back at the wall with the Night King.
and DAENERYS look back at the wall with the Night King.,Because the enemy is real. It's always been real.
And you say you can't defeat them without my armies and my dragons?,"No, I don't think I can."
I will fight for you. I will fight for the north...when you bend the knee.,"My people won't accept a southern ruler, not after everything they've suffered."
They will if their king does. They chose you to lead them. They chose you to protect them. Isn't their survival more important than your pride?,"and DAENERYS, DAVOS and MISSANDEI are walking out of the cave. As they exit TYRION and VARYS are standing on the beach awaiting them. DAENERYS begins addressing Tyrion."
What do you think I should do?,I would never presume to --
begins walking close to JON.,looks over the ocean at the dragons flying.
looks over the ocean at the dragons flying.,I never thought that dragons would exist again. No one did. The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen. Maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen. Build a world that's different from the shit one they've always known.

glances back towards the dragons.,"But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities, you're not different. You're just more of the same."
collects her sword. SANSA walks away. BAELISH remains on the balcony staring at ARYA who looks up at him. BAELISH bows to ARYA and walks away.,and DAVOS are walking along the paths outside of Dragonstone having a discussion.
What do you think of her?,Who?
I believe you know of whom I speak.,I think she has a good heart.
A good heart? I've noticed you starring at that good heart.,"There's no time for that. I saw the Night King, Davos. I looked into his eyes. How many men do we have in the north to fight him? 10,000? Less?"
Fewer.,What?
"King Snow, isn't it? No? That doesn't sound right. King Jon?",It doesn't matter.
"Forgive me, but may I ask a question?",Of course.
"Your name is Jon Snow, but your father's name was Ned Stark?",I'm a bastard. My mother and father weren't married.
The sounds liberating.,Why did you leave your homeland?
I was stolen away by slavers.,I'm sorry.
I serve my queen because I want to serve my queen. Because I believe in her.,And if you wanted to sail home to Naarth tomorrow --
Then she would give me a ship and wish me good fortune.,You believe that?
You'll forgive me if I switch sides.,notices a single ship sailing into the bay. It has a kraken sigil. MISSANDEI turns to look.
notices a single ship sailing into the bay. It has a kraken sigil. MISSANDEI turns to look.,Is that a Greyjoy ship?
"Sansa, is she all right?",grabs THEON by his shirt and pulls him face to face.
grabs THEON by his shirt and pulls him face to face.,What you did for her is the only reason I'm not killing you.
What you did for her is the only reason I'm not killing you.,releases THEON.
Euron has her. I came to ask the queen to help get her back.,The queen is gone.
So we fight and die or we submit and die. I know my choice. A soldier should know his.,SNOW is standing on the edge of a cliff looking towards the ocean. DROGON roars and flies over him with DAENERYS on his back. DROGON lands next to JON and charges towards him. DROGON opens his jaws and roars in JON's face. DROGON creeps closer until he is inches from JON. JON removes his glove and slowly extends his hand toward DROGON. DROGON lowers his head and allows JON to touch him. DAENERYS looks surprised and steps down from her mount. DROGON turns and flies away.
"They're beautiful, aren't they?","That wasn't the word I was thinking of, but, yes, they are. Gorgeous beasts."
turns to look at her three dragons as they fly over Dragonstone in the distance.,You weren't gone long.
No.,And?
And I have fewer enemies today than I did yesterday.,pauses and doesn't say anything.
You're not sure how you feel about that?,"No, I'm not."
How many men did your army kill taking Winterfell back from the Boltons?,Thousands.
We both want to help people. We can only help them from a position of strength. Sometimes strength is terrible. When you first came here Ser Davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people.,Ser Davos gets carried away.
So it was a figure of speech?,doesn't say anything. A group of Dothraki guards approach DAENERYS and speak in their native tongue.
"Jon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont, an old friend.",I served with your father. He was a great man.
and VARYS are seated at the painted table. TYRION and JORAH stand near the queen. DAVOS and JON SNOW are standing on the other end of the table. JON is holding a raven scroll and reading it.,I thought Arya was dead. I thought Bran was dead.
I'm happy for you. You don't look happy.,Bran saw the Night King and his army marching towards Eastwatch. If they make it past the wall --
The Wall has kept them out for thousands of years. Presumably --,interrupts VARYS.
interrupts VARYS.,I need to go home.
You said you don't have enough men.,We'll fight with the men we have. Unless you'll join us.
Perhaps not. Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children. What if we prove her wrong?,I don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation.
Is that possible?,The first White I ever saw was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall.
Fair point. How do you propose to find one?,pauses and stares at the ground. JORAH breaks the silence.
You asked me to find a cure so I could serve you. Allow me to serve you.,The free folk will help us. They know the real north better than anyone.
They won't follow Ser Jorah.,They won't have to.
You can't lead a raid beyond the wall. You're not in the Night's Watch anymore. You're King in the North.,I'm the only one here whose fought them. I'm the only one here who knows them.
I haven't given you permission to leave.,"With respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission. I am a king. And I came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive. I put my trust in you, a stranger, because I knew it was the best chance for my people, for all our people. Now I'm asking you to trust in a stranger because it's our best chance."
"Begging your pardon, Your Grace.",stops and turns around to face DAVOS.
stops and turns around to face DAVOS.,You survived King's Landing.
Yet again.,"Your Grace, this is --"
"It's Gendry, Your Grace. I'm Robert Baratheon's son. Bastard son.",looks to DAVOS.
Our fathers trusted each other. Why shouldn't we?,I saw your father once at Winterfell.
I met yours in my shop.,You're a lot leaner.
You're a lot shorter.,stops smiling and pauses a moment. Then he chuckles.
stops smiling and pauses a moment. Then he chuckles.,I grew up on stories about them.
"No, but I'm a fighter. And he won't be needing a smith with a sword like that.",Do you know how to use one?
shakes his head.,"Well, that's a problem."
He can handle himself.,nods.
nods.,We could use the help.
"reaches forward and takes JORAH by his hands. JON SNOW, DAVOS and GENDRY exit the cave and walk towards the boats. JORAH bends and kisses DAENERY's hand. He turns and continues readying the boat. JON stands in front of DAENERYS.",If I don't return at least you won't have to deal with the King in the North anymore.
But I've grown used to him.,"I wish you good fortune in the wars to come, Your Grace."
nods to JON. JON turns and walks to the head of the boat. The men take hold of it.,Heave!
"turns and walks away. BAELISH enters his room and shuts the door. ARYA continues watching. A moment later BAELISH opens the door and exits the room, locking the door as he leaves. After he is gone ARYA walks to the door and produces a lockpick from her sleeve. She enters the room and begins searching for the raven scroll. She opens a cabinet but finds nothing of value. She checks another cabinet, then looks in the fireplace and above the mantle finding nothing. She lifts up the mattress and finds a small hole cut into the bedding. She reaches in and retrives the raven scroll. She unrolls it and reads the contents.",and the raiding party land on the Beach of Eastwatch. JON looks up at the castle. The men collect their equipment and make for the castle.
How many queens are there now?,Two.
And you need to convince the one with the dragons or the one who fucks her brother?,Both.
How many men did you bring?,looks around the table.
looks around the table.,Not enough.
The big woman?,smiles and shakes his head. TORMUND is disappointed.
My scouts found them a mile south of the Wall. Said they were on their way here.,You're The Hound. I saw you once at Winterfell.
Is it worse than sitting in a freezing cell waiting to die?,He's right. We're all on the same side.
How can we be?,We're all breathing.
CREDITS,Are you all right?
faces JON and grunts.,Ever been north before?
"Beautiful, eh? I can breath again. Down south the air smells like pig shit.",You've never been down south.
I've been to Winterfell.,That's the north.
"You have to keep moving. That's the secret. Walking is good, fighting is better, fucking is best.",There's not another woman within 100 miles of here.
We have to make due with what we've got.,glances at GENDRY. GENDRY backs away from JON and TORMUND.
This one is maybe not so smart.,Davos says he is a strong fighter.
"Smart people don't come up here looking for the dead. So, you met this Dragon Queen, huh? And?",She'll only fight beside us if I bend the knee.
Good lad.,The first time I went north of the wall was with your father.
He was a good man. He deserved a better son. Were you with him at the end?,I was a prisoner of the Wildlings. But we avenged him. I want you to know that every mutineer found justice.
"I can't think of a worse way for him to go. The Night's Watch was his life. He would have died to protect every one of those men, and they butchered him.",I hate that he died that way. My father was the most honorable man I ever met. He was good all the way through. And he died on the executioner's block.
Your father wanted to execute me.,I heard.
and JON glance at each other.,I'm glad he didn't capture you.
Me too.,stops walking and loosens the belt holding his sword.
stops walking and loosens the belt holding his sword.,"Your father gave me this sword. He changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf, but it's still Long Claw."
"Your father gave me this sword. He changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf, but it's still Long Claw.",hands the sword to JORAH. JORAH slowly takes the sword and looks it over in his hands.
hands the sword to JORAH. JORAH slowly takes the sword and looks it over in his hands.,Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros.
stops examining the sword and looks up to JON.,But you are back and it's been in your family for centuries. It's not right for me to have it.
He gave it to you.,I'm not his son.
You don't much look like him.,Who's that?
Your father. I suppose you favor your mother.,You knew him?
Of course I did. When he was Hand he sent me off hunting for The Mountain. Your Wildling friend told me the red woman brought you back. Thoros has brought me back six times. We both serve the same lord.,I serve the north.
The north didn't raise you from the dead.,The lord of light never spoke to me. I don't know anything about him. I don't know what he wants from me.
He wants you alive.,Why?
I don't know.,"That's all anyone can tell me, I don't know. So what's the point in serving a god that none of us knows what he wants."
I think about that all the time. I don't think it's our purpose to understand except one thing. We're soldiers. We have to know what we're fighting for. I'm not fighting so some man or woman I barely know can sit on a throne made of swords.,So what are you fighting for?
Life. Death is the enemy. The first enemy and the last.,But we all die.
The enemy always wins. And we still need to fight him. That's all I know. You and I wont find much joy while we're here. But we can keep others alive. We can defend those who can't defend themselves.,I am the shield that guards the realms of men.
Maybe we don't need to understand any more than that. Maybe that's enough.,Aye. Maybe that's enough.
Cover that wall!,How many people live here?
"A million, give or take.",That's more people than the entire North crammed into that. Why would anyone want to live that way?
Then why are we here?,This isn't about living in harmony. It's just about living. The same thing is coming for all of us. A general you can't negotiate with. An army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield. Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city. They're about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead.
I imagine for most of them it would be an improvement.,This is serious. I wouldn't be here if it weren't.
There is no conversation that will erase the last 50 years. We have something to show you.,We can destroy them by burning them.
We can destroy them by burning them.,"And we can destroy them with dragonglass. If we don't win this fight, then that is the fate of every person in the world."
"And we can destroy them with dragonglass. If we don't win this fight, then that is the fate of every person in the world.",There is only one war that matters the Great War. And it is here.
Can they swim?,No.
"I would never ask it of you. You would never agree to it. And if you did, I would trust you even less than I do now. I ask it only of Ned Stark's son. I know Ned Stark's son.",I am true to my word. Or I try to be. That is why I cannot give you what you ask. I cannot serve two queens. And I have already pledged myself to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.
"I'm grateful for your loyalty, but my dragon died so that we could be here. If it's all for nothing, then he died for nothing.",I know!
I'm pleased you bent the knee to our queen,I'm not going to swear an oath I can't uphold. Talk about my father.
I don't want Cersei to murder me either. I could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble.,I did this. I should go.
You're pregnant.,No one is less happy about this than I am.
"This place was the beginning of the end for my family. A dragon is not a slave. They were terrifying. Extraordinary. They filled people with wonder and awe, and we locked them in here. They wasted away. They grew small. And we grew small as well. We weren't extraordinary without them. We were just like everyone else.",You're not like everyone else. And your family hasn't seen its end. You're still here.
I can't have children.,Who told you that?
The witch who murdered my husband.,Has it occurred to you she might not have been a reliable source of information?
"You were right from the beginning. If I had trusted you, everything would be different.","So, what now?"
I can't forget what I saw north of the Wall. And I can't pretend that Cersei won't take back half the country the moment I march north.,It appears Tyrion's assessment was correct. We're fucked.
Lady,"If we have the Dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad, they'll arrive at Winterfell within the fortnight."
"Perhaps you should fly to Winterfell, Your Grace. You have many enemies in the North. Thousands fell fighting your fatherAll it takes is one angry man with a crossbow. He'll see your silver hair on the kingsroad and know that one well-placed bolt will make him a hero. The man who killed the conqueror.","It's your decision, Your Grace. But if we're going to be allies in this war, it's important for the Northerners to see us as allies. If we sail to White Harbor together, I think it sends a better message."
Can I speak with you?,All right.
"What you did in King's Landing, what you said... You couldo ve lied to Cersei about bending the knee to Daenerys. You risked everything to tell an enemy the truth.",We went down there to make peace. And it seems to me we need to be honest with each other if we're going to fight together.
"You've always known what was right. Even when we were all young and stupid, you always knew. Every step you take it's always the right step.","It's not. It may seem that way from the outside, but I promise you, it's not true. I've done plenty of things that I regret."
"Not compared to me, you haven't.",No. Not compared to you.
I always wanted to do the right thing. Be the right kind of person. But I never knew what that meant. It always seemed like there's like there was an impossible choice I had to make. Stark or Greyjoy.,Our father was more of a father.
He was.,And you betrayed him. Betrayed his memory.
I did.,But you never lost him. He's a part of you. Just like he's a part of me.
But the things I've done.,"It's not my place to forgive you for all of it. But what I can forgive, I do. You don't need to choose. You're a Greyjoy and you're a Stark."
"When I was Ramsay's prisoner, Yara tried to save me. She's the only one who tried to save me. She needs me now.","So, why are you still talking to me?"
"Because I have balls, and you don't.",I warned you. Northerners don't much trust outsiders.
I warned you. Northerners don't much trust outsiders.,Look at you.
Look at you.,You're a man.
Almost.,Where's Arya?
Lurking somewhere.,"Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen. My sister, Sansa Stark, the Lady of Winterfell."
You'll have as many as we can spare. Hurry back to Last Hearth and bring your people here.,We need to send ravens to the Night's Watch as well. There's no sense in manning the castles anymore. We make our stand here.
A lord? Nothing at all?,It's not important.
King of the North!,"You did, my lady. It was the honor of my life. I'll always be grateful for your faith. But when I left Winterfell, I told you we need allies or we will die. I have brought those allies home to fight alongside us. I had a choice, keep my crown or protect the North. I chose the North."
You used to be taller.,How did you sneak up on me?
How did you survive a knife through the heart?,I didn't.
I didn't.,You still have it.
Needle.,Have you ever used it?
Valyrian steel.,Jealous?
Too heavy for me.,Where were you before? I couldo ve used your help with Sansa.
"She doesn't like your queen, does she?",Sansa thinks she's smarter than everyone.
She's the smartest person I've ever met.,Now you're defending her?
Now you're defending her?,You?
I'm defending our family. So is she.,Yeah. I'm her family too.
Your sister doesn't like me.,"She doesn't know you. If it makes you feel any better, she didn't like me either when we were growing up."
Only eighteen goats and eleven sheep.,What's the matter?
The dragons are barely eating.,What's wrong with them?
Go on.,I don't know how to ride a dragon.
Nobody does. Until they ride a dragon.,What if he doesn't want me to?
"Then I've enjoyed your company, Jon Snow.",What do I hold onto?
Whatever you can.,You've completely ruined horses for me.
No one would find us.,We'd be pretty old.
We'd be pretty old.,It's cold up here for a southern girl.
"Lord Glover wishes us good fortune, but he's staying in Deepwood Motte with his men.",House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousand years. Isn't that what he said?
The King in the North.,I told you we needed allies.
You didn't tell me you were going to abandon your crown.,"I never wanted a crown. All I wanted was to protect the North. I brought two armies home with me, two dragons."
And a Targaryen queen.,"Do you think we can beat the Army of the Dead without her? I fought them, Sansa. Twice. You want to worry about who holds what title, I'm telling you it doesn't matter. Without her, we don't stand a chance."
"Do you think we can beat the Army of the Dead without her? I fought them, Sansa. Twice. You want to worry about who holds what title, I'm telling you it doesn't matter. Without her, we don't stand a chance.",Do you have any faith in me at all?
You know I do.,She'll be a good queen. For all of us. She's not her father.
I'm not his brother. He trusts you more than anyone. Now's the time.,Sam?
"I'm sorry, I know I'm not supposed to be down here.",Were you hiding from me?
Of course not.,What are you doing in Winterfell? Or did you read every book in the Citadel already?
What are you doing in Winterfell? Or did you read every book in the Citadel already?,What's wrong? Gilly? Is she all right?
She's good.,Little Sam?
Don't you know?,Know what?
She didn't tell you.,I'm so sorry. We need to end this war.
Would you have done it?,"Well, I've executed men who disobeyed me."
You've also spared men. Thousands of wildlings when they refused to kneel.,I wasn't a king.
But you were. You've always been.,"I gave up my crown, Sam."
"I gave up my crown, Sam.",I bent the knee. I'm not King in the North anymore.
Bran and I worked it out. I had a High Septon's diary. Bran had whatever Bran has.,What are you talking about?
"And your father- your real father was Rhaegar Targaryen. You've never been a bastard. You're Aegon Targaryen, true heir to the Iron Throne. I'm sorry, I know it's a lot to take in.",My father was the most honorable man I ever met. You're saying he lied to me all my life.
"No. Your father- Well, Ned Stark. He promised your mother he'd always protect you. And he did. Robert would have murdered you if he knew. You're the true king. Aegon Targaryen, Sixth of His Name, Protector of the Realm, all of it.",Daenerys is our queen.
She shouldn't be.,That's treason.
What does the Warden of the North say about it?,We need every man we can get.
My little crow.,I thought we'd lost you.
Almost.,How did you find each other?
The dead got there first.,The Umbers?
We had to travel around them to get here. Whoever's not here now is with them.,How long do we have?
The big woman still here?,They're coming.
They're coming.,We have dragonglass and Valyrian steel.
We have dragonglass and Valyrian steel.,But there are too many of them.
But there are too many of them.,Far too many.
Far too many.,Our enemy doesn't tire.
Our enemy doesn't tire.,Doesn't stop. Doesn't feel.
Doesn't stop. Doesn't feel.,We can't beat them in a straight fight.
"So, what can we do?",The Night King made them all. They follow his command. If he falls Getting to him may be our best chance.
He always knows where I am.,"We'll put you in the crypt, where it's safest."
The dragons should give us an edge in the field.,"If they're in the field, they're not protecting Bran. We need to be near him. Not too near, or the Night King won't come. But close enough to pursue him when he does."
But at least we die together.,Let's get some rest.
Let's get some rest.,Your Grace.
Have you told her yet?,No.
And now our watch begins.,Gilly? Little Sam?
They'll be safe down in the crypt.,If you want to join them.
If you want to join them.,To protect them.
"Think back to where we started. Us, Grenn, Pyp.",Now it's just us three.
Who's that?,Lyanna Stark.
"My brother, Rhaegar, everyone told me he was decent and kind. He liked to sing. Gave money to poor children. And he raped her.",He didn't. He loved her.
He didn't. He loved her.,"They were married in secret. After Rhaegar fell on the Trident, she had a son. Robert would have murdered the baby if he ever found out, and Lyanna knew it. So the last thing she did, as she bled to death on her birthing bed, was give the boy to her brother, Ned Stark, to raise as his bastard."
"They were married in secret. After Rhaegar fell on the Trident, she had a son. Robert would have murdered the baby if he ever found out, and Lyanna knew it. So the last thing she did, as she bled to death on her birthing bed, was give the boy to her brother, Ned Stark, to raise as his bastard.",My name. My real name is Aegon Targaryen.
That's impossible.,I wish it were.
Who told you this?,Bran. He saw it.
He saw it?,And Samwell confirmed it. He read about their marriage at the Citadel without even knowing what it meant.
A secret no one in the world knew except your brother and your best friend. Doesn't seem strange to you?,"It's true, Dany. I know it is."
Cease fire!,The Night King is coming.
Stand your ground!,Dany!
There!,Get off!
"Come on! Come on! No! No, no, no!",Bran!
I'm hurt.,We're here to say goodbye to our brothers and sisters. To our fathers and mothers. To our friends. Our fellow men and women who set aside their differences to fight together and die together so that others might live. Everyone in this world owes them a debt that can never be repaid. It is our duty and our honor to keep them alive in memory for those who come after us and those who come after them for as long as men draw breath. They were the shields that guarded the realms of men. And we shall never see their like again.
The Northern armies?,Just crossed the Trident. They'll be at the walls of King's Landing in two days. How is she?
"She hasn't seen anyone since we returned. Hasn't left her chambers, hasn't accepted any food.",She shouldn't be alone.
You're worried for her. I admire your empathy.,Aren't you worried for her?
"I'm worried for all of us. They say every time a Targaryen is born, the gods toss a coin and the world holds its breath.",We're not much for riddles where I'm from.
We both know what she's about to do.,That's her decision to make. She is our queen.
"Men decide where power resides, whether or not they know it.",What do you want?
All I've ever wanted. The right ruler on the Iron Throne. I still don't know how her coin has landed. But I'm quite certain about yours.,I don't want it. I never have.
"I have known more kings and queens than any man living. I've heard what they say to crowds, and seen what they do in the shadows. I have furthered their designs, however horrible. But what I tell you now is true",She is my queen.
What did I say would happen if you told your sister?,"I don't want it, and that's what I told him."
She betrayed your trust. She killed Varys as much as I did. This was a victory for her. Now she knows what happens when people hear the truth about you. Far more people in Westeros love you than love me. I don't have love here. I only have fear.,I love you. And you will always be my queen.
She wants to attack now.,Daybreak at the earliest.
"No, no, no!","Move, move!"
Hurry up!,No! Get back! Get back!
No! Get back! Get back!,Stay! Stay!
Quickly. Quickly.,Stop!
Go! Go!,Find somewhere to hide.
Fucking die!,We need to fall back! Fall back behind the wall! Fall back!
Fall back!,Get out of the city! Fall back! Fall back! Fall back!
I'll find you later.,It's not safe. Let me send some men with you.
"In the name of the one true queen, Daenerys Targaryen, I sentence you to die.",Grey Worm!
Grey Worm!,It's over.
"I obey my queen's commands, not yours.",And what are the queen's commands?
Take him.,What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?,"Hey, what happened?"
I came to kill Cersei. Your queen got there first.,She's everyone's queen now.
Try telling Sansa.,Wait for me outside the city gates. I'll come find you.
Did you bring any wine?,No.
So is there life after death?,Not that I've seen.
I should be thankful. Oblivion is the best I could hope for. I strangled my lover. I shot my own father with a crossbow. I betrayed my queen.,You didn't.
"I did. And I'd do it again, now that I've seen what I've seen. I chose my fate. The people of King's Landing did not.",I can't justify what happened. I won't try. But the war is over now.
She liberated the people of Slaver's Bay. She liberated the people of King's Landing. And she'll go on liberating until the people of the world are free and she rules them all.,"And you've been by her side, counseling her. Until today."
Until today. Varys was right. I was wrong. It was vanity to think I could guide her. Our queen's nature is fire and blood.,"You think our house words are stamped on our bodies when we're born and that's who we are? Then I'd be fire and blood too. She's not her father, no more than you're Tywin Lannister."
"My father was an evil man. My sister was an evil woman. Pile up all the bodies of all the people they ever killed, there still won't be half as many as our beautiful queen slaughtered in a single day.",Cersei left her no choice.
"The moment the gates fell, the battle was over.",She saw her friend beheaded. She saw her dragon shot out of the sky.
And she burned down a city for it.,"Ah, it's easy to judge when you're standing far from the battlefield."
Would you have done it?,What?
"You've been up there, on a dragon's back. You've had that power. Would you have burned the city down?",I don't know.
"Yes, you do. You won't say because you don't want to betray her but you know.",What's it matter what I'd do?
I know you love her. I love her too. Not as successfully as you. But I believed in her with all my heart. Love is more powerful than reason. We all know that. Look at my brother.,Love is the death of duty.
You just came up with that?,Maester Aemon said it a long time ago.
It's a terrible thing I'm asking. It's also the right thing. Do you think I'm the last man she'll execute? Who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?,That's her decision. She is the queen.
That's her decision. She is the queen.,I'm sorry it came to this.
And your sisters? Do you see them bending the knee?,My sisters will be loyal to the throne.
Why do you think Sansa told me the truth about you? Because she doesn't want Dany to be queen.,She doesn't get to choose.
"When I was a girl, my brother told me it was made with a thousand swords from Aegon's fallen enemies. What do a thousand swords look like in the mind of a little girl who can't count to twenty? I imagined a mountain of swords too high to climb. So many fallen enemies, you could only see the soles of Aegon's feet.",I saw them executing Lannister prisoners in the street. They said they were acting on your orders.
It was necessary.,"Necessary? Have you been down there? Have you seen? Children, little children, burned!"
I tried to make peace with Cersei. She used their innocence as a weapon against me. She thought it would cripple me.,And Tyrion?
"He conspired behind my back with my enemies. How have you treated people who've done the same to you, even when it broke your heart?",Forgive him.
I can't.,"You can. You can forgive all of them, make them see they made a mistake. Make them understand."
"You can. You can forgive all of them, make them see they made a mistake. Make them understand.","Please, Dany."
We can't hide behind small mercies. The world we need won't be built by men loyal to the world we have.,The world we need is a world of mercy. It has to be.
And it will be. It's not easy to see something that's never been before. A good world.,How do you know? How do you know it'll be good?
Because I know what is good. And so do you.,I don't.
You do. You do. You've always known.,What about everyone else? All the other people who think they know what's good.

Right here.,Your Grace.
Your Grace.,I'm sorry I wasn't there when you needed me.
