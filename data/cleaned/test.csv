"We need this Dragonglass, My Lords. We know that Dragonglass can destroy both White Walkers and their army. We need to mine it and turn it into weapons.","But more importantly, we need allies. The Night King's army grows larger by the day. We can't defeat them on our own. We don't have the numbers. Daenerys has her own army and she has dragon fire. I need to try and persuade her to fight with us. Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow, then sail for Dragonstone."
You asked me to find a cure so I could serve you. Allow me to serve you.,The free folk will help us. They know the real north better than anyone.
Alright.,grabs Grenn's arm* Hold the gate. If they make it through...
Are you a virgin?,No.
"While we're preparing for attack, we need to shore up our defenses. The only thing standing between us and the Army of the Dead is the Wall and the Wall hasn't been properly manned in centuries. I'm not the king of the Free Folk.",But if we're going to survive this winter together...
l - l can't.,You can't what?
"Alright, alright! Enough of that.","You mistake me, my Lord. That was a command, not an offer. Pack your arms and armour, say your farewells, and ride for Greyguard."
I expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.,"If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. Tell him I'd visit if I could."
"When I was a girl, my brother told me it was made with a thousand swords from Aegon's fallen enemies. What do a thousand swords look like in the mind of a little girl who can't count to twenty? I imagined a mountain of swords too high to climb. So many fallen enemies, you could only see the soles of Aegon's feet.",I saw them executing Lannister prisoners in the street. They said they were acting on your orders.
The Army of the Dead is real. The White Walkers are real. The Knight King is real. I've seen them. If they get past the wall and we're squabbling amongst ourselves --,we're finished.
You're as far from Joffrey as anyone I've ever met.,Thank you.
Because... You're a bastard from the north.,"I never met my mother. My father wouldn't even tell me her name. I don't know if she's living or dead. I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife... Or a whore. So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. But I couldn't do it. Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? It's not a good life for a child."
"You saved their bloody lives. If they're going to live in the Seven Kingdoms, safe behind our wall, they ought to fight for the damn place.",It's not their fight!
"You have to be smarter than Father. You need to be smarter than Robb. I loved them, I miss them, but they made stupid mistakes, and they both lost their heads for it.",And how should I be smarter? By listening to you?
"Begging your pardon, Your Grace.",stops and turns around to face DAVOS.
He can handle himself.,nods.
"Listen to me, please. He wants you to make a mistake.",Of course he does. What should I do differently?
"And we can destroy them with dragonglass. If we don't win this fight, then that is the fate of every person in the world.",There is only one war that matters the Great War. And it is here.
Of course not.,What are you doing in Winterfell? Or did you read every book in the Citadel already?
Where are you going?,I'm going to find Mance.
I hope you're not thinking of doing anything stupid.,My sisters were in King's Landing too.
So what good are they?,They help the men march.
The dead got there first.,The Umbers?
I could try. . What? I've read about it. A bit.,"I'm sorry Sam, we can't help her."
What did you do?,"I followed him. He took the baby into the woods, the newborn."
"Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you? What's your story, bastard?","Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf."
Of course you do. Who stopped Rattleshirt when he was about to cut your throat? Who vouched for you with Mance? It seems you owe me a debt.,Give it back.
"And the drummers- is that a great honor, too?",Usually it's the young boys banging the drums.
What do you think?,Who was he?
"Jon, wait! Don't you see what they're doing?","I see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all."
Then l consent.,Sam said you wanted to see me?
What are men of the Night's Watch doing in a Wildling camp?,I was sent to discuss terms with the king beyond the wall.
Fewer.,What?
They haven't heard of you either. . But we need men and they have some.,And how many men does this Lord Mazin have to send us?
You must allow them their flights of fancy. It's dreary in the north.,Amazing thing to see.
Good man. Have you swung it yet?,Of course I have.
I can't have children.,Who told you that?
"Think back to where we started. Us, Grenn, Pyp.",Now it's just us three.
He your king now?,I don't have a king.
He came to your aid. Stannis. Now he needs you!,We don't have enough men to make any difference.
"Just a boy. He came trading with his brothers. He had red hair like me. Kissed by fire. But he was weak. Not like you. That was the first one. Then there was this Thenn boy. Spoke no Common, but gods, he was built like a mammoth.","Yeah, thanks. I think I've heard enough. We'd best get back. Tormund-"
I want you to tell me what it was like to have someone. To be with someone. To love someone and have them love you back. We're all gonna die a lot sooner than I'd planned. You're the closest I'll ever get to know it.,So you and Gilly never-
How many men did your army kill taking Winterfell back from the Boltons?,Thousands.
I said you can't. They find a nice cave to hide in while the sun's up and do their killing when it's dark.,We could do the same.
I believe you know of whom I speak.,I think she has a good heart.
Because I know what is good. And so do you.,I don't.
I miss girls.,Why is he alone?
They won't kneel for you and neither will I.,I don't want them to kneel for me. I want them to fight with me when the time comes.
"Thank you for traveling so far, My Lords. I hope the seas weren't too rough.","The winds were kind, Your Grace."
I'll have to try.,I'm ordering you not to bring me back.
Name's Locke.,Jon Snow.
"I ordered Mance Rayder burnt at the stake. You prevented that order from being carried out. You showed mercy to Mance Rayder. A king's word is law. Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos how much mercy I show to lawbreakers. Show too much kindness, people won't fear you. If people don't fear you, they don't follow you.","With respect, Your Grace, the free folk will never follow you, no matter what you do. You're the man who burned their king alive."
Here? There's no shelter here.,There's no shelter anywhere.
I should go back for Gilly.,We have orders. No one's to leave the castle.
Good. At some point I want to hear how a Knight's Watch recruit became King in the North.,As long as you tell me how a Lannister became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen.
Where have you been?,Watch duty. With Sam.
Lurking somewhere.,"Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen. My sister, Sansa Stark, the Lady of Winterfell."
The Northern armies?,Just crossed the Trident. They'll be at the walls of King's Landing in two days. How is she?
What's the matter? Can't be the first time you pressed your bone against a woman's arse.,Let's move.
"Sam, I'd like to speak to the maester alone.",How are you feeling?
You're not sure how you feel about that?,"No, I'm not."
"I'm sorry, I know I'm not supposed to be down here.",Were you hiding from me?
The kind I don't want to believe.,m ready. I won't let you down.
You're right. It's a bad plan. What's your plan?,"They held the gate. Get some brothers down here to help you. You need to burn the bodies. Raise the outer gate, then lower it again as soon as I'm out."
What we did.,It doesn't feel right.
Valyrian steel.,Jealous?
I don't think he can see us.,Pyp? Sam?
We've been fighting them all for thousands of years. They've slaughtered villages. They've slaughtered our brothers.,And we've slaughtered theirs.
You attacking us?,"No, it's like you said, we don't have the men."
Fuck the glass! We're gonna die here.,Go! Go! Go!
"I will not go meekly off to freeze and die! Give it to one of the fools who cast a stone for you. I will not have it. Do you hear me, boy? I will not have it!",Are you refusing to obey my order?
No? You put your sword through a brother of the Night's Watch. What do you call that?,He wanted me to kill him.
Valar morghulis.,"Ygritte, you know I didn't have a choice. You always knew who I was, what I am."
"Anyway, there's nothing for him to interpret. We didn't. So what's it like?","It's...there's this person, this whole other person. And you're wrapped up in them and they're wrapped up in you and...you...for a little...for a little while you're more than just you, you're...well I don't know, I'm not a bleedin' poet!"
Your eyes are still brown Is that still you in there?,I think so Hold off on burning my body for now
They're not going anywhere. They've got Craster's food and his wives. Poor girls. Never thought they'd miss their daddy. Karl's running things now. He's the one who put a knife through Craster's mouth.,We need to ride north and kill them all.
You saw what?,I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods. I saw what took it.
Is this true?,Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men. I fought them at Hardhome. We both lost.
"If you ever come back this way, I will execute you myself.",I'm having the lordo s chamber prepared for you.
They'll kill you if they find out you've gone.,They'll kill you if they know you came after me. Go back.
Windmill. Who built it? Some king?,Just the men who used to live here.
I can be quick.,You'll have to work at it every day. How does it feel? Do you like the balance?
"I swear it, Old Master King Crow, ser, we were only close together for warmth. And then I felt it, right up against me backside like a club. I can show you the bruise on me tailbone. And before I knew what was where, his his Well, it was all out in the open, all angry as you like. And I didn't want to want it, but oh, I did! And he spread me legs and ruined. The shame of it. Now I can never marry a perfumed lord. What will me poor savage father say?",Turn back around.
We both know what she's about to do.,That's her decision to make. She is our queen.
I don't care about ravens. You're asking me to join your army. Who is fighting in this army?,The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings.
But I've grown used to him.,"I wish you good fortune in the wars to come, Your Grace."
"I've been ready to die for many years. If the Lord was done with me, so be it, but he's not. You've seen the Night King, Jon Snow. You know the great war is still to come. You know the army of the dead will be upon us soon. And you know I can help you win that war.","Ride south today. If you return to the North, I'll have you hanged as a murderer."
And you think you're free? You swore some stupid oath and now you can never touch a girl.,It was my choice to say the words.
"I'll do anything, please! No, please stop it!","Ghost, stay with us. Ghost!"
"They must have been great builders, stacking stones so high.",Winterfell has towers three times that size.
There's a difference between sneaking off to the Mole's Town brothel and sleeping with the enemy.,"While we sit here debating which rules I broke, Mance Rayder marches on the Wall with an army of 100,000."
Why are you laughing?,What did father used to say? Everything before the word but is horse shit.
The free folk? Listen to him. He even talks like a wildling now.,"Aye, I talk like a wildling. I ate with the wildlings. I climbed the Wall with the wildlings. I... I laid with a wildling girl."
Who's this little girl? You're prettier than half my daughters. You got a nice wet twat between your legs? What's your name?,Jon Snow.
"What would you have me do, , Lord Commander?",I'd have you go north of the Wall. Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here. I'll open the gates for them and let them through. I'll find them lands to settle south of the Wall.
"Come on, Ghost.",Mance's army was closing in on Craster's Keep when we left. We saw their campfires from Osric's Hill. They'll reach the Wall before the next full moon.
"Aye, Castle Black. Everyone knows Castle Black. Which others?",Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and the Shadow Tower.
"You admit to breaking your vows, then?",I do.
I warned you. Northerners don't much trust outsiders.,Look at you.
"I wish I could have convinced him to come back with me. I tried. Really, I did.",How fast could they travel? A crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton?
It's not enough. We need more men.,There's no time.
What about you?,I'm not a Stark. Get on.
"Then let me say my vows. If it's a fight you're heading for, then you need men who know how.","Thank you, brothers."
"You two. Take it slow, try and disarm each other.",You know how to fight. You could have gone easier on him.
"Aye, the snows defeated Stannis as much as the Boltons did.",We have to march on Winterfell now while we still can.
Stop it!,You're still moving.
So here we are.,Here we are.
Where will you go?,"Where will we go? If I don't watch over you, Father's ghost will come back and murder me"
Our fathers trusted each other. Why shouldn't we?,I saw your father once at Winterfell.
"Your foray to Craster's Keep, I'll sanction it. But I won't order anyone to go with you. Volunteers only.","Thank you, Ser Alliser."
The King in the North.,I told you we needed allies.
Why aren't you in chains?,He's not my prisoner.
My uncle the Blackfish has reformed it and retaken Riverrun.,How do you know that?
I'm defending our family. So is she.,Yeah. I'm her family too.
"Remember Mance's camp? It stretched all the way to the horizon. And look at us now. Look what's left of us. And if we lose this, we're gone. Dozens of tribes, hundreds of generations. Be like we were never there at all. We'll be the last of the free folk.","That's what'll happen to you if we lose. The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers, they know you're here. They know that more than half of you are women and children. After they finish with me, they'll come for you. You're right. This isn't your fight. You shouldn't have to come to Winterfell with me. I shouldn't be asking you. It's not the deal we made. I need you with me if we're gonna beat them, and we need to beat them if you're going to survive."
"No, I won't. I'm like you, Ary. I'm a survivor.",Come in.
"And Sansa, I hear she's alive and well.",She is.
And a Targaryen queen.,"Do you think we can beat the Army of the Dead without her? I fought them, Sansa. Twice. You want to worry about who holds what title, I'm telling you it doesn't matter. Without her, we don't stand a chance."
I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time. I'm leaving this morning.,You're leaving?
"Go on, let's have a look.",At what?
"I've offended you. Forgive me, it's been a rough morning. Anyway, don't despair. I'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I've learned to live with it. Your next tumble with Ros is on me. I'll try not to wear her out.","Leg, shoulder, leg. Left foot forward. Good. Now pivot as you deliver the stroke. Put all your weight behind it."
"I might be your prisoner, but I'm a free woman.","If you're my prisoner, you're not a free woman. That's what prisoner means."
Stand.,"Yesterday's wars don't matter anymore. The North needs to band together, all the living north. Will you stand beside me, Ned and Alys, now and always?"
You're abandoning your people. Your abandoning your home.,I'm leaving both in good hands.
"A letter for you, Lord Commander.",I'm not Lord Commander anymore.
"Cut her loose, too. Do you see her sulking about it? That's because she understands the way things are.",And are you gonna share it with me? The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird?
"They'll never let you within a hundred yards of him. And if you did, even if you managed to kill him.",He'll kill me. If I don't go he'll kill me anyway. They'll kill the rest of us too.
They'll be safe down in the crypt.,If you want to join them.
"It's Gendry, Your Grace. I'm Robert Baratheon's son. Bastard son.",looks to DAVOS.
The day I ask my people to fight with the crows is the day my people cut my guts from my belly and make me eat them.,"And how many of your people can't fight? The women, the children, the old, the sick, what happens to them? You're condemning them to death. Worse than death because you're too proud to make peace. Or maybe you're not proud. Maybe you're just a coward."
Who would that be?,The builders.
Lord Commander.,How can I help you?
"Would you please shut up? You think you're better than me, crow. I'm a free woman.",You're a free woman?
stops looking at the walls and turns to look at JON. JON walks to another wall and begins to examine the murals. The murals depict Children of the Forest and the First Men standing together.,They were here together the Children and the First Men.
"You're alright. You're alright. I'll get help. Shh, shh. Maester Aemon is coming, he's gonna make it alright.",Now!
That good?,Better.
He wants me to bend the knee. And he wants the free folk to fight for him. I'll give him this much,Shouldn't a king be bold?
"No, it's a proper Northern drink, Jon Snow. You did well. Fought hard. Killed some of our strongest men. One of our giants went into your tunnel and never came out again. Mag the Mighty.",He's dead. He killed my friend Grenn.
Is it worse than sitting in a freezing cell waiting to die?,He's right. We're all on the same side.
How do you know that?,Because I've made that claim.
I'm not gonna scare it. I'm gonna kill it.,It's too far away.
But you'd be Lord of Winterfell.,"I swore a vow to the Night's Watch. If I don't take my own word seriously, what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be?"
Sam…,You've just been beaten half to death. How did you--
We held them off.,For one night.
"It's silly, isn't it? What, we can't defend the Wall unless we're celibate? It's absurd.",I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.
How did you survive a knife through the heart?,I didn't.
Hmm?,He marries his daughters. What does he do with his sons?
Careful with that. You might cut yourself.,"Never swung a sword before, have you? You look like a baby with a rattle."
"If they get through, everyone dies !",Night's Watch with me! Move! Move! Move!
"Don't think too much, Bran.",Relax your bow arm.
Do it. They'll find us if you don't.,You were right the whole time.
Who am I? Who am I?,Lord commander.
What do you think he'd have done with him?,"I was this man's prisoner once. He couldo ve tortured me, he couldo ve killed me, but he spared my life. I think my father wouldo ve taken him prisoner, listened to what he had to say."
"Oh, you mean right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot? You need help remembering that? When Mance gives the signal and we hit Castle Black, we won't be banging on drums to let them know we're coming.","No. No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know you're coming."
You used to be taller.,How did you sneak up on me?
"People make all sorts of plans. I haven't seen Benjen Stark in three years. Haven't missed him. Always treated me like scum. . Haven't had any good wine for a long time. You Southerners make good wine, I'll give you that.",We're not Southerners.
Whatever you can.,You've completely ruined horses for me.
"No, but it will be.",You know what Stannis wants?
I fucking hate Thenns.,How many are with us? 5000?
"Beautiful, eh? I can breath again. Down south the air smells like pig shit.",You've never been down south.
"She is here to reclaim the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms. The north is one of those seven kingdoms. This isn't an invitation, it's a trap.","It could be, but I don't believe Tyrion would do that. You know him. He's a good man."
What are you doing?,I promised Jeor I'd never lose it again. *he hands the sword to Sam* In case I don't come back.
"Half the men hate you already, Lord Commander. Do it.",But you don't know what it is.
How?,"Well, it's- it's the rhythm."
"Lady of Bear Island, and a child of 10. I asked her to commit her house to my cause, that's her response.","Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark."
Quickly. Quickly.,Stop!
"Take good care of him. . Brothers. As you all know too well, it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit. . First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task. . Brian. Seems like a good job for a ginger.","Ser Alliser. . You have more experience than any other soldier at Castle Black. You proved your valour many times over, while defending the Wall from the wildling attack. I name you First Ranger."
"Wun Wun, to the sea.",Let's go now! Now!
"There is something else I want to show your, Your Grace.",and DAENERYS go to a further chamber in the cave. There are murals painted on the walls of Dragonglass.
He saw it?,And Samwell confirmed it. He read about their marriage at the Citadel without even knowing what it meant.
turns to look at her three dragons as they fly over Dragonstone in the distance.,You weren't gone long.
I don't know. They'd pass wildling villages. They could try to find shelter at one of them.,The wildlings have joined up with Mance. Every village or sheltered place will be deserted. Except...
There's only one war. Life against death. Come. Let me show what you're fighting for. .,"You're gonna show me some vision in the fire. Forgive me, my Lady. But I don't trust in visions."
I find that hard to believe.,"I came very close once. I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but..."
"No, I don't think so. I think what you want most of all is to be a hero. I'll ask you one last time ... why do you want to join us?",We stopped at Craster's Keep on the way north. I saw...
Fall back!,Get out of the city! Fall back! Fall back! Fall back!
"I can't think of a worse way for him to go. The Night's Watch was his life. He would have died to protect every one of those men, and they butchered him.",I hate that he died that way. My father was the most honorable man I ever met. He was good all the way through. And he died on the executioner's block.
"They fought together against their common enemy. Despite their differences, despite their suspicions, together. We need to do the same if we're going to survive.",and DAENERYS look back at the wall with the Night King.
You're speaking to the one true king boy. You'll address him as your grace.,"I know he's the king. My father died for him. My name is Jon Snow, your grace. I'm Ned Stark's son."
"Only a fool would trust Littlefinger. I should have told you about him, about the Knights of the Vale. I'm sorry.",We need to trust each other. We can't fight a war amongst ourselves. We have so many enemies now.
"Farewell, Snow.","And you, Stark."
It's so skinny.,"So are you. I had the blacksmith make it for you special. It won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough."
Doing what? Fighting each other?,takes DAENERYS by the arm and swings her torch to another part of the wall. There is a mural of the Night King and White Walkers.
This is… bad time to start.,Having a rough time of it?
I know.,"I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister."
They were right here standing where we're standing before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters. Maybe even before there were men.,No.
And how do you know that?,"Every boy in the North knows it. We grow up learning it. Where the battles were fought, the names of the heroes, who died where. Six times you've invaded and six times you've failed. The seventh will be the same."
I'm giving you a chance to avenge your family. To take back the castle where you grew up. To rule the North.,"I wish I could fight beside you. Believe me, I do. But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood. I pledged my life to the Night's Watch."
Ready your arrows!,Get in line! Get in line!
Very nice. Good.,A lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand. First thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds.
The Wall has kept them out for thousands of years. Presumably --,interrupts VARYS.
"In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, first of his name …",Don't look away.
I've reconsidered. I think that sounds like a wonderful idea.,We're going to bury my brother in the crypt next to my father.
Lord Ashford. . Lady Caulfield. . Lord Smallwood.,Never even heard of these people.
She liberated the people of Slaver's Bay. She liberated the people of King's Landing. And she'll go on liberating until the people of the world are free and she rules them all.,"And you've been by her side, counseling her. Until today."
"It was all nonsense. Everybody knew it. But then Mormont saw them and you saw them, and I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows.",How do I convince people who don't know me that an enemey they don't believe in is coming to kill them all?
We still have a wall between us and the Night King. Theres nothing between us and Cersei.,There's a thousand miles between us and Cersei. Winter is here. The Lannisters are a southern army. They've never ranged this far north.
The Army of the Dead?,"You don't know me well, My Lord, but do you think I am a liar or a madman?"
"Well, you rip my pretty silk dress, I'll blacken your eye.",Maybe one day I'll take you to Winterfell.
Yet again.,"Your Grace, this is --"
Take Lord Janos outside.,"Olly, bring me my sword."
"If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple. Take care, Snow.","Farewell, My Lord."
I think we've had enough small talk. What are you here?,Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black before he marched on Winterfell and was killed. He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men. It said- -
Where you gonna go?,South
You can call me Sam... If you want. My mother calls me Sam.,"It's not going to get any easier, you know? You'll have to defend yourself."
A maid. You were a maid.,I was a man of the Night's Watch. How about you? Were you a maid?
"A raven from King's Landing, Your Grace.","Cersei of House Lannister, First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms--"
You shouldn't be alive It's not right,Neither was killing me
"Bring me a horn of ale, Snow, and pour one for yourself.",Is there any word of my father?
Wildlings?,One blast is for rangers returning. Wildlings is two blasts.
"You don't mean it, do you? Telling the wildlings you want to make peace. You're just doing it to trick them.",It's not a trick.
We've been preparing.,We should seal the tunnel. Plug it with rocks and ice. Flood it and let it freeze.
That thing you did with your mouth- is that what lords do to their ladies in the South?,I don't know. I just wanted to kiss you there is all.
"I was sorry when he died. Your father and I had our differences but he loved Cat very much. So did I. She wasn't fond of you, was she? Well, it appears she vastly underestimated you. Your father and brothers are gone, yet here you stand King in the North. Last best hope against the coming storm.",You don't belong down here.
Snow. Did you love her? She loved you.,She told you?
How long till we get back to your crows?,We're close.
You.,Are you all right? Come with me. Come on.
"Why don't you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies, and I'll figure out what to do about your walking dead men.",It's hard for me to fathom. It really is. If someone told me about the White Walkers and the Night King --
"It appears my trusting nature got the better of me. It's happened before. I was hoping your loyalty was real when you pledged yourself to us, Jon Snow, truly I was.","The Halfhand ordered me to join your army and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black. He made me kill him so you'd trust me. I was loyal, to him and to my Night's Watch vows."
Lord Snow. What do you think you're doing?,Grenn and I were helping them.
Your Grace.,I'm sorry I wasn't there when you needed me.
